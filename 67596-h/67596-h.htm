</div>


<p class="drop-cap">TEN thousand dollars a year! Neil Kittrell left
the office of the <i>Morning Telegraph</i> in a daze.
He was insensible of the raw February air, heedless
of sloppy pavements; the gray day had suddenly
turned gold. He could not realize it all at once; ten
thousand a year&mdash;for him and Edith! His heart
swelled with love of Edith; she had sacrificed so
much to become the wife of a man who had tried to
make an artist of himself, and of whom fate, or economic
determinism, or something, had made a cartoonist.
What a surprise for her! He must hurry
home.</p>

<p>In this swelling of his heart he felt a love not only
of Edith but of the whole world. The people he met
seemed dear to him; he felt friendly with every one,
and beamed on perfect strangers with broad, cheerful
smiles. He stopped to buy some flowers for Edith&mdash;daffodils,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
or tulips, which promised spring, and he
took the daffodils, because the girl said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think yellow is such a spirituelle color, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221; and inclined her head in a most artistic manner.</p>

<p>But daffodils, after all, which would have been
much the day before, seemed insufficient in the light
of new prosperity, and Kittrell bought a large azalea,
beautiful in its graceful spread of pink blooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where shall I send it?&#8221; asked the girl, whose
cheeks were as pink as azaleas themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll call a cab and take it to her myself,&#8221;
said Kittrell.</p>

<p>And she sighed over the romance of this rich
young gentleman and the girl of the azalea, who, no
doubt, was as beautiful as the young woman who
was playing <i>Lottie, the Poor Saleslady</i> at the Lyceum
that very week.</p>

<p>Kittrell and the azalea bowled along Claybourne
Avenue; he leaned back on the cushions, and adopted
the expression of ennui appropriate to that thoroughfare.
Would Edith now prefer Claybourne
Avenue? With ten thousand a year they could, perhaps&mdash;and
yet, at first it would be best not to put on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
airs, but to go right on as they were, in the flat.
Then the thought came to him that now, as the cartoonist
on the <i>Telegraph</i>, his name would become as
well known in Claybourne Avenue as it had been in
the homes of the poor and humble during his years
on the <i>Post</i>. And his thoughts flew to those homes
where tired men at evening looked for his cartoons
and children laughed at his funny pictures. It gave
him a pang; he had felt a subtle bond between himself
and all those thousands who read the <i>Post</i>. It
was hard to leave them. The <i>Post</i> might be yellow,
but, as the girl had said, yellow was a spiritual color,
and the <i>Post</i> brought something into their lives&mdash;lives
that were scorned by the <i>Telegraph</i> and by
these people on the avenue. Could he make new
friends here, where the cartoons he drew and the
<i>Post</i> that printed them had been contemned, if not
despised? His mind flew back to the dingy office of
the <i>Post</i>; to the boys there, the whole good-natured,
happy-go-lucky gang; and to Hardy&mdash;ah, Hardy!&mdash;who
had been so good to him, and given him his big
chance, had taken such pains and interest, helping
him with ideas and suggestions, criticism and sympathy.
To tell Hardy that he was going to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
him, here on the eve of the campaign&mdash;and Clayton,
the mayor, he would have to tell him, too&mdash;oh, the
devil! Why must he think of these things now?</p>

<p>After all, when he had reached home, and had run
up-stairs with the news and the azalea, Edith did not
seem delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, dearie, business is business,&#8221; he argued,
&#8220;and we need the money!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know; doubtless you&#8217;re right. Only please
don&#8217;t say &#8216;business is business;&#8217; it isn&#8217;t like you,
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But think what it will mean&mdash;ten thousand a
year!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Neil, I&#8217;ve lived on ten thousand a year before,
and I never had half the fun that I had when
we were getting along on twelve hundred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but then we were always dreaming of the
day when I&#8217;d make a lot; we lived on that hope,
didn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>Edith laughed. &#8220;You used to say we lived on
love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not serious.&#8221; He turned to gaze moodily
out of the window. And then she left the azalea,
and perched on the flat arm of his chair.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>&#8220;Dearest,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am serious. I know all
this means to you. We&#8217;re human, and we don&#8217;t like
to &#8216;chip at crusts like Hindus,&#8217; even for the sake of
youth and art. I never had illusions about love in a
cottage and all that. Only, dear, I have been happy,
so very happy, with you, because&mdash;well, because I
was living in an atmosphere of honest purpose, honest
ambition, and honest desire to do some good
thing in the world. I had never known such an atmosphere
before. At home, you know, father and
Uncle James and the boys&mdash;well, it was all money,
money, money with them, and they couldn&#8217;t understand
why I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could marry a poor newspaper artist! That&#8217;s
just the point.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, dear! If they couldn&#8217;t understand, so
much the worse for them. If they thought it meant
sacrifice to me, they were mistaken. I have been
happy in this little flat; only&mdash;&#8221; she leaned back and
inclined her head with her eyes asquint&mdash;&#8220;only the
paper in this room is atrocious; it&#8217;s a typical landlord&#8217;s
selection&mdash;McGaw picked it out. You see
what it means to be merely rich.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>She was so pretty thus that he kissed her, and
then she went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;And so, dear, if I didn&#8217;t seem to be as impressed
and delighted as you hoped to find me, it is because
I was thinking of Mr. Hardy and the poor, dear,
common little <i>Post</i>, and then&mdash;of Mr. Clayton. Did
you think of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to&mdash;to cartoon him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact he had not allowed himself to face was
close to both of them, and the subject was dropped
until, just as he was going down-town&mdash;this time to
break the news to Hardy&mdash;he went into the room he
sarcastically said he might begin to call his studio,
now that he was getting ten thousand a year, to look
for a sketch he had promised Nolan for the sporting
page. And there on his drawing-board was an unfinished
cartoon, a drawing of the strong face of
John Clayton. He had begun it a few days before
to use on the occasion of Clayton&#8217;s renomination. It
had been a labor of love, and Kittrell suddenly realized
how good it was. He had put into it all of his
belief in Clayton, all of his devotion to the cause for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
which Clayton toiled and sacrificed, and in the simple
lines he experienced the artist&#8217;s ineffable felicity;
he had shown how good, how noble, how true a man
Clayton was. All at once he realized the sensation
the cartoon would produce, how it would delight
and hearten Clayton&#8217;s followers, how it would please
Hardy, and how it would touch Clayton. It would
be a tribute to the man and the friendship, but now
a tribute broken, unfinished. Kittrell gazed a moment
longer, and in that moment Edith came.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dear, beautiful soul!&#8221; she exclaimed softly.
&#8220;Neil, it is wonderful. It is not a cartoon; it is a
portrait. It shows what you might do with a brush.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kittrell could not speak, and he turned the drawing-board
to the wall.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Edith sat and thought&mdash;of
Neil, of the new position, of Clayton. He had loved
Neil, and been so proud of his work; he had shown
a frank, na&iuml;ve pleasure in the cartoons Neil had
made of him. That last time he was there, thought
Edith, he had said that without Neil the &#8220;good old
cause,&#8221; as he called it, using Whitman&#8217;s phrase,
could never have triumphed in that town. And now,
would he come again? Would he ever stand in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
room and, with his big, hearty laugh, clasp an arm
around Neil&#8217;s shoulder, or speak of her in his good,
friendly way as &#8220;the little woman?&#8221; Would he
come now, in the terrible days of the approaching
campaign, for rest and sympathy&mdash;come as he used
to come in other campaigns, worn and weary from
all the brutal opposition, the vilification and abuse
and mud-slinging? She closed her eyes. She could
not think that far.</p>

<p>Kittrell found the task of telling Hardy just as
difficult as he expected it to be, but by some mercy it
did not last long. Explanation had not been necessary;
he had only to make the first hesitating approaches,
and Hardy understood. Hardy was, in a
way, hurt; Kittrell saw that, and rushed to his own
defense:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate to go, old man. I don&#8217;t like it a little bit&mdash;but,
you know, business is business, and we need
the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>He even tried to laugh as he advanced this last
conclusive reason, and Hardy, for all he showed in
voice or phrase, may have agreed with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Kit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry; I wish
we could pay you more, but&mdash;well, good luck.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>That was all. Kittrell gathered up the few articles
he had at the office, gave Nolan his sketch, bade the
boys good-by&mdash;bade them good-by as if he were going
on a long journey, never to see them more&mdash;and
then he went.</p>

<p>After he had made the break it did not seem so
bad as he had anticipated. At first things went on
smoothly enough. The campaign had not opened,
and he was free to exercise his talents outside the
political field. He drew cartoons dealing with banal
subjects, touching with the gentle satire of his humorous
pencil foibles which all the world agreed
about, and let vital questions alone. And he and
Edith enjoyed themselves: indulged oftener in
things they loved; went more frequently to the theater;
appeared at recitals; dined now and then down-town.
They began to realize certain luxuries they
had not known for a long time&mdash;some he himself
had never known, some that Edith had not known
since she left her father&#8217;s home to become his bride.
In more subtle ways, too, Kittrell felt the change:
there was a sense of larger leisure; the future
beamed with a broader and brighter light; he formed
plans, among which the old dream of going ere long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
to Paris for serious study took its dignified place.
And then there was the sensation his change had
created in the newspaper world; that the cartoons
signed &#8220;Kit,&#8221; which formerly appeared in the <i>Post</i>,
should now adorn the broad page of the <i>Telegraph</i>
was a thing to talk about at the press club; the fact
of his large salary got abroad in that little world as
well, and, after the way of that world, managed to
exaggerate itself, as most facts did. He began to be
sensible of attentions from men of prominence&mdash;small
things, mere nods in the street, perhaps, or
smiles in the theater foyer, but enough to show that
they recognized him. What those children of the
people, those working-men and women who used to
be his unknown and admiring friends in the old days
on the <i>Post</i>, thought of him&mdash;whether they missed
him, whether they deplored his change as an apostasy
or applauded it as a promotion&mdash;he did not
know. He did not like to think about it.</p>

<p>But March came, and the politicians began to bluster
like the season. Late one afternoon he was on
his way to the office with a cartoon, the first in which
he had seriously to attack Clayton. Benson, the
managing editor of the <i>Telegraph</i>, had conceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
it, and Kittrell had worked on it that day in sickness
of heart. Every lying line of this new presentation
of Clayton had cut him like some biting acid; but he
had worked on, trying to reassure himself with the
argument that he was a mere agent, devoid of personal
responsibility. But it had been hard, and when
Edith, after her custom, had asked to see it, he had
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t want to see it; it&#8217;s no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it of&mdash;him?&#8221; she had asked.</p>

<p>And when he nodded she had gone away without
another word. Now, as he hurried through the
crowded streets, he was conscious that it was no
good, indeed; and he was divided between the artist&#8217;s
regret and the friend&#8217;s joy in the fact. But it made
him tremble. Was his hand to forget its cunning?
And then, suddenly, he heard a familiar voice, and
there beside him, with his hand on his shoulder,
stood the mayor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Neil, my boy, how are you?&#8221; he said, and
he took Kittrell&#8217;s hand as warmly as ever. For a
moment Kittrell was relieved, and then his heart
sank; for he had a quick realization that it was the
coward within him that felt the relief, and the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
the sickness. If Clayton had reproached him, or cut
him, it would have made it easier; but Clayton did
none of these things, and Kittrell was irresistibly
drawn to the subject himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard of my&mdash;new job?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Clayton, &#8220;I heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&#8221; Kittrell began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; Clayton said.</p>

<p>&#8220;So was I,&#8221; Kittrell hastened to say. &#8220;But I felt
it&mdash;well, a duty, some way&mdash;to Edith. You know&mdash;we&mdash;need
the money.&#8221; And he gave the cynical
laugh that went with the argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does <i>she</i> think? Does she feel that way
about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kittrell laughed, not cynically now, but uneasily
and with embarrassment, for Clayton&#8217;s blue eyes
were on him, those eyes that could look into men and
understand them so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you know,&#8221; Kittrell went on nervously,
&#8220;there is nothing personal in this. We newspaper
fellows simply do what we are told; we obey
orders like soldiers, you know. With the policy of
the paper we have nothing to do. Just like Dick Jennings,
who was a red-hot free-trader and used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
write free-trade editorials for the <i>Times</i>&mdash;he went
over to the <i>Telegraph</i>, you remember, and writes all
those protection arguments.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mayor did not seem to be interested in Dick
Jennings, or in the ethics of his profession.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, you know I&#8217;m for you, Mr. Clayton,
just exactly as I&#8217;ve always been. I&#8217;m going to vote
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>This did not seem to interest the mayor, either.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, maybe, you know&mdash;I thought, perhaps,&#8221; he
snatched at this bright new idea that had come to
him just in the nick of time, &#8220;that I might help you
by my cartoons in the <i>Telegraph</i>; that is, I might
keep them from being as bad as they might&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that wouldn&#8217;t be dealing fairly with your
new employers, Neil,&#8221; the mayor said.</p>

<p>Kittrell was making more and more a mess of this
whole miserable business, and he was basely glad
when they reached the corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, good-by, my boy,&#8221; said the mayor, as they
parted. &#8220;Remember me to the little woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kittrell watched him as he went on down the
avenue, swinging along in his free way, the broad
felt hat he wore riding above all the other hats in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the throng that filled the sidewalk; and Kittrell
sighed in deep depression.</p>

<p>When he turned in his cartoon, Benson scanned it
a moment, cocked his head this side and that, puffed
his brier pipe, and finally said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid this is hardly up to you. This figure
of Clayton, here&mdash;it hasn&#8217;t got the stuff in it. You
want to show him as he <i>is</i>. We want the people to
know what a four-flushing, hypocritical, demagogical
blatherskite he is&mdash;with all his rot about the people
and their damned rights!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benson was all unconscious of the inconsistency
of having concern for a people he so despised, and
Kittrell did not observe it, either. He was on the
point of defending Clayton, but he restrained himself
and listened to Benson&#8217;s suggestions. He remained
at the office for two hours, trying to change
the cartoon to Benson&#8217;s satisfaction, with a growing
hatred of the work and a disgust with himself
that now and then almost drove him to mad destruction.
He felt like splashing the piece with India ink,
or ripping it with his knife. But he worked on, and
submitted it again. He had failed, of course; failed
to express in it that hatred of a class which Benson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
unconsciously disguised as a hatred of Clayton, a
hatred which Kittrell could not express because he
did not feel it; and he failed because art deserts her
devotees when they are false to truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;ll have to do,&#8221; said Benson, as he looked
it over; &#8220;but let&#8217;s have a little more to the next one.
Damn it! I wish I could draw. I&#8217;d cartoon the
crook!&#8221;</p>

<p>In default of which ability, Benson set himself to
write one of those savage editorials in which he
poured out on Clayton that venom of which he
seemed to have such an inexhaustible supply.</p>

<p>But on one point Benson was right: Kittrell was
not up to himself. As the campaign opened, as the
city was swept with the excitement of it, with meetings
at noon-day and at night, office-seekers flying
about in automobiles, walls covered with pictures of
candidates, hand-bills scattered in the streets to swirl
in the wild March winds, and men quarreling over
whether Clayton or Ellsworth should be mayor,
Kittrell had to draw a political cartoon each day;
and as he struggled with his work, less and less the
old joy came to cheer and spur him on. To read the
ridicule, the abuse, which the <i>Telegraph</i> heaped on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Clayton, the distortion of facts concerning his candidature,
the unfair reports of his meetings, sickened
him, and more than all, he was filled with disgust
as he tried to match in caricature these libels
of the man he so loved and honored. It was bad
enough to have to flatter Clayton&#8217;s opponent, to picture
him as a noble, disinterested character, ready
to sacrifice himself for the public weal. Into his
pictures of this man, attired in the long black coat of
conventional respectability, with the smug face of
pharisaism, he could get nothing but cant and hypocrisy;
but in his caricatures of Clayton there was
that which pained him worse&mdash;disloyalty, untruth,
and now and then, to the discerning few who knew
the tragedy of Kittrell&#8217;s soul, there was pity. And
thus his work declined in value; lacking all sincerity,
all faith in itself or its purpose, it became false, uncertain,
full of jarring notes, and, in short, never
once rang true. As for Edith, she never discussed
his work now; she spoke of the campaign little, and
yet he knew she was deeply concerned, and she grew
hot with resentment at the methods of the <i>Telegraph</i>.
Her only consolation was derived from the
Post, which, of course, supported Clayton; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
final drop of bitterness in Kittrell&#8217;s cup came one
evening when he realized that she was following with
sympathetic interest the cartoons in that paper.</p>

<p>For the <i>Post</i> had a new cartoonist, Banks, a boy
whom Hardy had picked up somewhere and was
training to the work Kittrell had laid down. To
Kittrell there was a cruel fascination in the progress
Banks was making; he watched it with a critical,
professional eye, at first with amusement, then with
surprise, and now at last, in the discovery of Edith&#8217;s
interest, with a keen jealousy of which he was
ashamed. The boy was crude and untrained; his
work was not to be compared with Kittrell&#8217;s, master
of line that he was, but Kittrell saw that it had the
thing his work now lacked, the vital, primal thing&mdash;sincerity,
belief, love. The spark was there, and Kittrell
knew how Hardy would nurse that spark and
fan it, and keep it alive and burning until it should
eventually blaze up in a fine white flame. And Kittrell
realized, as the days went by, that Banks&#8217; work
was telling, and that his own was failing. He had,
from the first, missed the atmosphere of the <i>Post</i>,
missed the <i>camaraderie</i> of the congenial spirits there,
animated by a common purpose, inspired and led by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Hardy, whom they all loved&mdash;loved as he himself
once loved him, loved as he loved him still&mdash;and dare
not look him in the face when they met!</p>

<p>He found the atmosphere of the <i>Telegraph</i> alien
and distasteful. There all was different; the men had
little joy in their work, little interest in it, save perhaps
the newspaper man&#8217;s inborn love of a good
story or a beat. They were all cynical, without loyalty
or faith; they secretly made fun of the <i>Telegraph</i>,
of its editors and owners; they had no belief
in its cause; and its pretensions to respectability, its
parade of virtue, excited only their derision. And
slowly it began to dawn on Kittrell that the great
moral law worked always and everywhere, even on
newspapers, and that there was reflected inevitably
and logically in the work of the men on that staff
the hatred, the lack of principle, the bigotry and intolerance
of its proprietors; and this same lack of
principle tainted and made meretricious his own
work, and enervated the editorials so that the <i>Telegraph</i>,
no matter how carefully edited or how dignified
in typographical appearance, was, nevertheless,
without real influence in the community.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Clayton was gaining ground. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
less than two weeks before election. The campaign
waxed more and more bitter, and as the forces opposed
to him foresaw defeat, they became ugly in
spirit, and desperate. The <i>Telegraph</i> took on a tone
more menacing and brutal, and Kittrell knew that the
crisis had come. The might of the powers massed
against Clayton appalled Kittrell; they thundered at
him through many brazen mouths, but Clayton held
on his high way unperturbed. He was speaking by
day and night to thousands. Such meetings he had
never had before. Kittrell had visions of him before
those immense audiences in halls, in tents, in
the raw open air of that rude March weather, making
his appeals to the heart of the great mass. A
fine, splendid, romantic figure he was, striking to the
imagination, this champion of the people&#8217;s cause, and
Kittrell longed for the lost chance. Oh, for one day
on the <i>Post</i> now!</p>

<p>One morning at breakfast, as Edith read the <i>Telegraph</i>,
Kittrell saw the tears well slowly in her
brown eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is shameful!&#8221; She clenched
her little fists. &#8220;Oh, if I were only a man I&#8217;d&mdash;&#8221; She
could not in her impotent feminine rage say what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
she would do; she could only grind her teeth. Kittrell
bent his head over his plate; his coffee choked
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest,&#8221; she said presently, in another tone,
&#8220;tell me, how is he? Do you&mdash;ever see him? Will
he win?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I never see him. But he&#8217;ll win; I wouldn&#8217;t
worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He used to come here,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;to rest a
moment, to escape from all this hateful confusion
and strife. He is killing himself! And they aren&#8217;t
worth it&mdash;those ignorant people&mdash;they aren&#8217;t worth
such sacrifices.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up from the table and turned away, and
then, realizing quickly, she flew to his side and put
her arms about his neck and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, dearest, I didn&#8217;t mean&mdash;only&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Edith,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is killing me. I feel
like a dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t dear; he is big enough, and good enough;
he will understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; that only makes it harder, only makes it
hurt the more.&#8221;</p>

<p>That afternoon, in the car, he heard no talk but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
of the election; and down-town, in a cigar store
where he stopped for cigarettes, he heard some men
talking mysteriously, in the hollow voice of rumor,
of some sensation, some scandal. It alarmed him,
and as he went into the office he met Manning, the
<i>Telegraph&#8217;s</i> political man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Manning,&#8221; Kittrell said, &#8220;how does it
look?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn bad for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, for our mob of burglars and second story
workers here&mdash;the gang we represent.&#8221; He took a
cigarette from the box Kittrell was opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;And will he win?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will he win?&#8221; said Manning, exhaling the words
on the thin level stream of smoke that came from
his lungs. &#8220;Will he win? In a walk, I tell you. He&#8217;s
got &#8217;em beat to a standstill right now. That&#8217;s the
dope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about this story of&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, that&#8217;s all a pipe-dream of Burns&#8217;. I&#8217;m
running it in the morning, but it&#8217;s nothing; it&#8217;s a
shine. They&#8217;re big fools to print it at all. But it&#8217;s
their last card; they&#8217;re desperate. They won&#8217;t stop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
at anything, or at any crime, except those requiring
courage. Burns is in there with Benson now; so is
Salton, and old man Glenn, and the rest of the bunco
family. They&#8217;re framing it up. When I saw old
Glenn go in, with his white side whiskers, I knew the
widow and the orphan were in danger again, and
that he was going bravely to the front for &#8217;em. Say,
that young Banks is comin&#8217;, isn&#8217;t he? That&#8217;s a peach,
that cartoon of his to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kittrell went on down the hall to the art-room to
wait until Benson should be free. But it was not
long until he was sent for, and as he entered the
managing editor&#8217;s room he was instantly sensible of
the somber atmosphere of a grave and solemn council
of war. Benson introduced him to Glenn, the
banker, to Salton, the party boss, and to Burns, the
president of the street-car company; and as Kittrell
sat down he looked about him, and could scarcely
repress a smile as he recalled Manning&#8217;s estimate of
Glenn. The old man sat there, as solemn and unctuous
as ever he had in his pew at church. Benson,
red of face, was more plainly perturbed, but Salton
was as reserved, as immobile, as inscrutable as ever,
his narrow, pointed face, with its vulpine expression,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
being perhaps paler than usual. Benson had on his
desk before him the cartoon Kittrell had finished that
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Kittrell,&#8221; Benson began, &#8220;we&#8217;ve been talking
over the political situation, and I was showing these
gentlemen this cartoon. It isn&#8217;t, I fear, in your best
style; it lacks the force, the argument, we&#8217;d like just
at this time. That isn&#8217;t the <i>Telegraph</i> Clayton, Mr.
Kittrell.&#8221; He pointed with the amber stem of his
pipe. &#8220;Not at all. Clayton is a strong, smart, unscrupulous,
dangerous man! We&#8217;ve reached a crisis
in this campaign; if we can&#8217;t turn things in the next
three days, we&#8217;re lost, that&#8217;s all; we might as well
face it. To-morrow we make an important revelation
concerning the character of Clayton, and we
want to follow it up the morning after by a cartoon
that will be a stunner, a clencher. We have discussed
it here among ourselves, and this is our idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benson drew a crude, bald outline, indicating the
cartoon they wished Kittrell to draw. The idea was
so coarse, so brutal, so revolting, that Kittrell stood
aghast, and, as he stood, he was aware of Salton&#8217;s
little eyes fixed on him. Benson waited; they all
waited.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Benson, &#8220;what do you think of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kittrell paused an instant, and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t draw it; that&#8217;s what I think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benson flushed angrily and looked up at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are paying you a very large salary, Mr. Kittrell,
and your work, if you will pardon me, has not
been up to what we were led to expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right, Mr. Benson, but I can&#8217;t draw
that cartoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, great God!&#8221; yelled Burns, &#8220;what have we
got here&mdash;a gold brick?&#8221; He rose with a vivid sneer
on his red face, plunged his hands in his pockets, and
took two or three nervous strides across the room.
Kittrell looked at him, and slowly his eyes blazed out
of a face that had gone white on the instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say, sir?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>Burns thrust his red face, with its prognathic
jaw, menacingly toward Kittrell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said that in you we&#8217;d got a gold brick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; said Kittrell. &#8220;What have you to do with
it? I don&#8217;t work for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t? Well, I guess it&#8217;s us that puts up&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen! Gentlemen!&#8221; said Glenn, waving a
white, pacificatory hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;Yes, let me deal with this, if you please,&#8221; said
Benson, looking hard at Burns. The street-car man
sneered again, then, in ostentatious contempt, looked
out the window. And in the stillness Benson continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Kittrell, think a minute. Is your decision
final?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is final, Mr. Benson,&#8221; said Kittrell. &#8220;And as
for you, Burns,&#8221; he glared angrily at the man, &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t draw that cartoon for all the dirty money
that all the bribing street-car companies in the world
could put into Mr. Glenn&#8217;s bank here. Good evening,
gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not until he stood again in his own home
that Kittrell felt the physical effects which the spiritual
squalor of such a scene was certain to produce
in a nature like his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neil! What is the matter?&#8221; Edith fluttered
toward him in alarm.</p>

<p>He sank into a chair, and for a moment he looked
as if he would faint, but he looked wanly up at her
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing; I&#8217;m all right; just a little weak. I&#8217;ve
gone through a sickening, horrible scene&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;Dearest!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m off the <i>Telegraph</i>&mdash;and a man once
more!&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent over, with his elbows on his knees, his
head in his hands, and when Edith put her calm,
caressing hand on his brow, she found that it was
moist from nervousness. Presently he was able to
tell her the whole story.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was, after all, Edith, a fitting conclusion to my
experience on the <i>Telegraph</i>. I suppose, though, that
to people who are used to ten thousand a year such
scenes are nothing at all.&#8221; She saw in this trace of
his old humor that he was himself again, and she
hugged his head to her bosom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dearest,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m proud of you&mdash;and
happy again.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were, indeed, both happy, happier than they
had been in weeks.</p>

<p>The next morning after breakfast, she saw by his
manner, by the humorous, almost comical expression
about his eyes, that he had an idea. In this mood
of satisfaction&mdash;this mood that comes too seldom
in the artist&#8217;s life&mdash;she knew it was wise to let him
alone. And he lighted his pipe and went to work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
She heard him now and then, singing or whistling
or humming; she scented his pipe, then cigarettes;
then, at last, after two hours, he called in a loud,
triumphant tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Edith!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was at the door in an instant, and, waving
his hand grandly at his drawing-board, he turned
to her with that expression which connotes the greatest
joy gods or mortals can know&mdash;the joy of beholding
one&#8217;s own work and finding it good. He
had, as she saw, returned to the cartoon of Clayton
he had laid aside when the tempter came; and now
it was finished. Its simple lines revealed Clayton&#8217;s
character, as the sufficient answer to all the charges
the <i>Telegraph</i> might make against him. Edith leaned
against the door and looked long and critically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was fine before,&#8221; she said presently; &#8220;it&#8217;s better
now. Before it was a portrait of the man; this
shows his soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s how he looks to me,&#8221; said Neil, &#8220;after
a month in which to appreciate him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what,&#8221; she said, stooping and peering at the
edge of the drawing, where, despite much knife-scraping,
vague figures appeared, &#8220;what&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m ashamed to tell you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have
to paste over that before it&#8217;s electrotyped. You see, I
had a notion of putting in the gang, and I drew four
little figures&mdash;Benson, Burns, Salton and Glenn;
they were plotting&mdash;oh, it was foolish and unworthy.
I decided I didn&#8217;t want anything of hatred
in it&mdash;just as he wouldn&#8217;t want anything of hatred
in it; so I rubbed them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad. It is beautiful; it makes up for
everything; it&#8217;s an appreciation&mdash;worthy of the
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Kittrell entered the office of the <i>Post</i>, the
boys greeted him with delight, and his presence made
a sensation, for there had been rumors of the break
which the absence of a &#8220;Kit&#8221; cartoon in the <i>Telegraph</i>
that morning had confirmed. But, if Hardy
was surprised, his surprise was swallowed up in his
joy, and Kittrell was grateful to him for the delicacy
with which he touched the subject that consumed
the newspaper and political world with curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad, Kit,&#8221; was all that he said. &#8220;You know
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he forgot everything in the cartoon, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
showed his instant recognition of its significance by
snatching out his watch, pushing a button, and saying
to Garland, who came to the door in his shirt-sleeves:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Nic to hold the first edition for a five-column
first-page cartoon. And send this up right
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had a last look at it before it went, and after
gazing a moment in silence Hardy said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the greatest thing you ever did, Kit, and it
comes at the psychological moment. It&#8217;ll elect him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he was elected anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardy shook his head, and in the movement Kittrell
saw how the strain of the campaign had told on
him. &#8220;No, he wasn&#8217;t; the way they&#8217;ve been hammering
him is something fierce; and the <i>Telegraph</i>&mdash;well,
your cartoons and all, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my cartoons in the <i>Telegraph</i> were rotten.
Any work that is not sincere, not intellectually honest&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardy interrupted him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but, Kit, you&#8217;re so good that your rotten
is better than &#8217;most anybody&#8217;s best.&#8221; He smiled,
and Kittrell blushed and looked away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Hardy was right. The &#8220;Kit&#8221; cartoon, back in the
<i>Post</i>, created its sensation, and after it appeared the
political reporters said it had started a landslide to
Clayton; that the betting was 4 to 1 and no takers,
and that it was all over but the shouting.</p>

<p>That night, as they were at dinner, the telephone
rang, and in a minute Neil knew by Edith&#8217;s excited
and delighted reiteration of &#8220;yes,&#8221; &#8220;yes,&#8221; who had
called up. And then he heard her say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I will; I&#8217;ll come every night and sit in the
front seat.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Kittrell displaced Edith at the telephone,
he heard the voice of John Clayton, lower in register
and somewhat husky after four weeks&#8217; speaking,
but more musical than ever in Kittrell&#8217;s ears when it
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I just told the little woman, Neil, that I didn&#8217;t
know how to say it, so I wanted her to thank you for
me. It was beautiful in you, and I wish I were
worthy of it; it was simply your own good soul expressing
itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>And it was the last delight to Kittrell to hear that
voice and to know that all was well.</p>

<p>But one question remained unsettled. Kittrell had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
been on the <i>Telegraph</i> a month, and his contract differed
from that ordinarily made by the members of
a newspaper staff in that he was paid by the year,
though in monthly instalments. Kittrell knew that
he had broken his contract on grounds which the sordid
law would not see or recognize and the average
court think absurd, and that the <i>Telegraph</i> might
legally refuse to pay him at all. He hoped the <i>Telegraph</i>
would do this! But it did not; on the contrary,
he received the next day a check for his
month&#8217;s work. He held it up for Edith&#8217;s inspection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ll have to send it back,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think me quixotic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re poor enough as it is&mdash;let&#8217;s have some
luxuries; let&#8217;s be quixotic until after election, at
least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Neil; &#8220;just what I was thinking.
I&#8217;m going to do a cartoon every day for the <i>Post</i>
until election day, and I&#8217;m not going to take a cent.
I don&#8217;t want to crowd Banks out, you know, and I
want to do my part for Clayton and the cause, and
do it, just once, for the pure love of the thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those last days of the campaign were, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
luxuries to Kittrell and to Edith, days of work and
fun and excitement. All day Kittrell worked on his
cartoons, and in the evening they went to Clayton&#8217;s
meetings. The experience was a revelation to them
both&mdash;the crowds, the waiting for the singing of
the automobile&#8217;s siren, the wild cheers that greeted
Clayton, and then his speech, his appeals to the best
there was in men. He had never made such speeches,
and long afterward Edith could hear those cheers
and see the faces of those working-men aglow with
the hope, the passion, the fervent religion of democracy.
And those days came to their glad climax
that night when they met at the office of the <i>Post</i> to
receive the returns, in an atmosphere quivering with
excitement, with messenger boys and reporters coming
and going, and in the street outside an immense
crowd, swaying and rocking between the walls on
either side, with screams and shouts and mad huzzas,
and the wild blowing of horns&mdash;all the hideous,
happy noise an American election-night crowd can
make.</p>

<p>Late in the evening Clayton had made his way,
somehow unnoticed, through the crowd, and entered
the office. He was happy in the great triumph he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
would not accept as personal, claiming it always for
the cause; but as he dropped into the chair Hardy
pushed toward him, they all saw how weary he was.</p>

<p>Just at that moment the roar in the street below
swelled to a mighty crescendo, and Hardy cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>

<p>They ran to the window. The boys up-stairs who
were manipulating the stereopticon, had thrown on
the screen an enormous picture of Clayton, the portrait
Kittrell had drawn for his cartoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you say now there isn&#8217;t the personal note
in it?&#8221; Edith asked.</p>

<p>Clayton glanced out the window, across the dark,
surging street, at the picture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s not me they&#8217;re cheering for,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;it&#8217;s for Kit, here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps some of it&#8217;s for him,&#8221; Edith admitted
loyally.</p>

<p>They were silent, seized irresistibly by the emotion
that mastered the mighty crowd in the dark
streets below. Edith was strangely moved. Presently
she could speak:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything sweeter in life than to know
that you have done a good thing&mdash;and done it well?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Clayton, &#8220;just one: to have a few
friends who understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said Edith. &#8220;It is so with art,
and it must be so with life; it makes an art of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was dark enough there by the window for her
to slip her hand into that of Neil, who had been
musing silently on the crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can never say again,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;that
those people are not worth sacrifice. They are worth
all; they are everything; they are the hope of the
world; and their longings and their needs, and the
possibility of bringing them to pass, are all that give
significance to life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what America is for,&#8221; said Clayton, &#8220;and
it&#8217;s worth while to be allowed to help even in a little
way to make, as old Walt says, &#8216;a nation of friends,
of equals.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE HAS-BEEN</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS HOLMAN loitered along the pavement that
June morning, glad once more to be back in
Springfield after so many years, he recalled with a
sigh another morning, far gone, when first he had
come up to the capital of his state. &#8220;A morning just
like this,&#8221; he was thinking, &#8220;all green and sunny and
hopeful and&mdash;pure. My God!&#8221; But he put aside
regret; it was enough just then to be back after so
many years of absence&mdash;years of dingy poverty
which had kept him down in stupid Jasper, never
once able to get back during the session, if only for
a day to see the boys!&mdash;even as a man of fifty, with
gray hair straggling beneath his broad, slouch hat,
with his long, dusty coat, and worn, old shoes, that
fell softly on the hot sidewalk, far other than the
young representative who had come up to the capital
so long before. In Capitol Avenue he had the state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
house in full view, the gray, swelling dome still
patiently brooding over the stupidities and trivialities
which the bickering human beings, running
about like insects below, were proudly and solemnly
achieving. The little flags were at their staffs on
either wing. Once, at the sight he might have hurried,
knowing his presence to be required beneath
that flag on the house wing. No need now to hasten
any more; he was not needed there, nor anywhere in
the world.</p>

<p>The sidewalk was filled with men striding like the
statesmen they felt themselves to be, and none
among them now to remember him; but he walked
with them under the railroad&#8217;s ugly trestle, past the
old white house on the little hill, still with its lightning-rod
to keep alive one of the best of Lincoln
stories, and up the broad walk to the state house. Inside,
the cool shades of the big pile were grateful as
they used to be. Through the open doors of offices he
could see clerks at work, or at least at desks, somehow
coming off victorious, it seemed, in their desperate
business of holding on to their slippery, eel-like,
political jobs; then the crowded elevator&mdash;and
the inevitable old soldier to operate it. All as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
used to be; and he, like some risen ghost long since
laid in its political grave, stalking among earthly
presences that had forgotten him.</p>

<p>The doorkeepers at the house regarded him with
the official misanthropy and distrust, but Holman
quelled their glance, pronounced the word &#8220;Ex-member,&#8221;
and so passed in to the one barren prerogative
left him out of the years of former power and
prestige.</p>

<p>The house, on the order of senate bills on first
reading, was inattentive; members lolled in their
seats, read newspapers, talked, gossiped, wrote letters,
now and then threw paper wads at one another&mdash;incipiencies
of that horseplay which would mark
the session&#8217;s close. The clerk mumbled the said senate
bills on first reading, the speaker turned in his chair
to talk with some one on the divan behind him,
swinging about now and then to say, &#8220;First reading
of the bill!&#8221; and to tap the sounding-board with his
gavel. And, of them all, not one he knew, not one
to recognize him! But, yes, there was one, after all;
just one. Down the center aisle, reclining in his
chair nonchalantly, was a young fellow, almost a
boy to Holman&#8217;s disadvantage point of years, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
head, turned at that instant, showed a profile which,
when age and authority should visit it, would cause
one to remark it; a fair brow, strong nose and good-humored
lips parting now in a smile at some remark
a member across the aisle had made. As Holman
looked at young McCray his mind went back to
another morning in another June, when the air
came in through the tall, open windows with the
breath of young summer in Illinois, the very odor
of the prairie flowers themselves, the morning
that Baldwin had come to him. And now McCray
sat there, representing his old district, with all the
opportunities, dreams, ambitions, illusions he himself
had had&mdash;and lost.</p>

<p>But Holman was not much given to introspection&mdash;his
eye was not long turned inward; and now,
turned outward, it lighted on a white head far down
toward the front of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, if there isn&#8217;t, after all, one o&#8217; the old-timers!
Say, young fellow,&#8221; he said, speaking to an
assistant sergeant-at-arms who had been standing
near and, unable to identify Holman as a representative
of any railroad or other interest entitled to
respect on that floor, had been eying him with some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
suspicion. &#8220;Say,&#8221; said Holman, pointing with a
long forefinger, &#8220;ain&#8217;t that old Ike Bemis down
there&mdash;Bemis, of Tazewell? Yes? Well, now, just
call a page boy, won&#8217;t you? And have him tell
Bemis an old friend wants to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bemis was, in his way, a phenomenon unparalleled
in politics; he had been in the house before
Holman and had held on, minority member from his
district, the Republican and Democratic machines
working harmoniously together, for a quarter of a
century. And as he came up the aisle in response
to Holman&#8217;s message he seemed to Holman to have
changed little; only his hair from iron gray had
grown white, and his face was not so clear or ruddy
or healthy as he had known it. He was dressed as
he used to be in the gray clothes that made him
look so like a prosperous farmer, and the hand he
held out to Holman was, by some mystery, rough
and horny, as if it had worked indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, bless the Lord!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t Jim
Holman!&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook Holman&#8217;s hand with genuine pleasure
and, putting his arm across Holman&#8217;s shoulders, led
him away to a divan under the gallery.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>They sat down there and for half an hour chatted
and gossiped, recalled old friends and associates of
legislatures that were gone, discussed them, accounted
for them, pursued their subsequent histories
in politics or out of politics, their triumphs, their
failures and their fates&mdash;in short, they reconstructed
their own little world and caught up with
the times.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t what it used to be, Jim,&#8221; said Bemis with
an old man&#8217;s deploration of change. &#8220;You did right
to get out of it. I don&#8217;t want any more of it. When
this session closes I&#8217;m through; I won&#8217;t run again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holman was not greatly impressed; politicians, he
knew, were always making their last campaign, as
sailors were always making their last voyage.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sine die</i> adjournment next week, and then good-by
to politics for me,&#8221; Bemis went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad
to be shut of it all. Nothing in it, nothing in it.&#8221;
He wagged his sage head sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything&mdash;ah&mdash;doing this session?&#8221; asked Holman,
glancing sidewise at his old colleague.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, nothing except this Chicago street-car bill.
We passed it, you know, and the governor vetoed it.
The reformers raised an awful howl. Comes up&mdash;let&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
see&mdash;to-night, I reckon. Going to try to pass
it over the governor&#8217;s veto.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will they make it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Looks dubious. The senate&#8217;s
all right, of course; it&#8217;s all fixed there, but the house
ain&#8217;t certain. A two-thirds vote&#8217;s hard to get these
days. Baldwin&#8217;s been working day and night&mdash;but
I don&#8217;t know; you can&#8217;t tell yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the house broke into new confusion. Holman
knew the signs well; a roll-call was on. Bemis
pricked his ears and hurried back to his seat.</p>

<p>Holman was glad just then to have him go, for
almost at the mention of the name of Baldwin he
had happened to glance toward the speaker&#8217;s chair;
the speaker had risen, his gavel poised, and in that
instant Holman saw the man on the speaker&#8217;s lounge,
lolling back to await the passing of the interruption,
and recognized Baldwin, George R. Baldwin, carefully
dressed as of old, suave, elegant, dignified, all
unchanged save that his hair had grown a bit more
gray, though only, it seemed, to lend to his aspect
new dignity, new authority, almost refinement.
Baldwin, the same as ever! It had not changed him,
evidently; he was still correct, irreproachable, respected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
received everywhere&mdash;while he, Holman,
had come to this. Sarah, back there at home, amid
the dingy poverty and drudgery of her life; and
Baldwin&#8217;s wife, doubtless, welcome in all society
and reigning there! Holman, sick of the scene, got
up, plunged his hands into his pockets and started
out. Near the door he turned to have another
glance. Baldwin had slid to the end of the lounge
and was talking to some young fellow&mdash;to McCray.</p>

<p>Holman went to the cigar stand, lighted a cigar,
sauntered out into the rotunda and leaned against
the brass rail. He blew out streams of smoke and
through squinting little eyes watched them float
away; he smoked and squinted and thought, and
what he saw was Baldwin, the lobbyist, and young
McCray.</p>

<p>Two men passed on their way over to the senate
chamber, and he heard one of them pronounce his
name.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;leaning on the rail there, smoking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I forgot; his face was familiar, too. The
old Has-been has come back for a day!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Baldwin who spoke; his companion was
young McCray.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>&#8220;Ah, yes! An old Has-been,&#8221; thought Holman.
Baldwin said that, and McCray! They said that
even down in Jasper. But Baldwin, he was no Has-been;
it had not affected him at all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Holman entered the house that afternoon
he was sensible of a change in the atmosphere. The
new element was one he recognized&mdash;skilled as of
old in legislative a&euml;roscepsy&mdash;one that strangely excited
him, both by what it recalled and by what it
portended; there were tension, alertness, irritability
and suspense, the knowledge of an evil, sinister
Presence, known, silent, unrevealed, but apprehended&mdash;a
Presence expected, even desired, yet
dreaded; in short, the psychic condition that exists
in a legislative chamber when something is about to
come off. Holman, standing well back by the cloak-room,
examining the house with expert eye, knew
that the thing was imminent, though not immediate.
There were certain signs wanting. The speaker sat
calm, but he was twirling his gavel nervously; the
leaders were restless and furtive, but they had not
as yet got every man in his seat. McCray, for instance,
was absent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Holman sauntered carelessly around to the side
on which Bemis sat, caught the old man&#8217;s eye and
beckoned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought they&#8217;d get that bill up,&#8221; said Holman,
&#8220;and I&#8217;d see a little fun; but there seems to be no
chance of that. Reckon I&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a hitch,&#8221; said Bemis in a low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has, heh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bemis; &#8220;the boys thought they had
it fixed, but Wimbleton switched; told O&#8217;Leary so
at noon. Either the governor got around him or
he got scared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Need only one vote?&#8221; surmised Holman. Then
Bemis, as if a thought had struck him, drew close
and put his lips to Holman&#8217;s ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that young McCray from your district?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, Jim, if you could fix him&mdash;you might
get in on this thing. He won&#8217;t do business with any
of us. I don&#8217;t know exactly, but I should think
there&#8217;d be for you and him at least&mdash;&#8221; He put his
lips quite into Holman&#8217;s ear, and Holman bent
lower; and Bemis whispered again. Holman did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
not move a muscle. Bemis withdrew a little and
looked at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know McCray very well,&#8221; said Holman
presently. &#8220;He&#8217;s a youngster, and I&#8217;ve been out of
politics a long time. But I might have a little talk
with him. I can&#8217;t promise, though&mdash;an old Has-been
like me, you know.&#8221; He laughed a small bitter
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you!&#8221; said Bemis striking him softly on the
shoulder. &#8220;You a Has-been! Why, Jim, you&#8217;re
the slickest man in southern Illinois&mdash;when you
want to be!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Holman found McCray in the Leland bar-room.
The young man was plainly in some mental stress,
his hair matted to his brow, his face moist with
perspiration, and drawn, and in his eyes an utter
weariness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the man I was looking for,&#8221; said Holman.
&#8220;I came to see you about a little matter down in
Jasper; some interests I represent&mdash;constits of yours&mdash;and
I&#8217;ve got to hurry back. So, just give me a
minute; I&#8217;ll not keep you long.&#8221;</p>

<p>McCray looked at his watch. &#8220;I&#8221;&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;&#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
must get over to the house; I&#8217;m late, anyway.
I was detained&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; said Holman, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve got to see
you. It&#8217;s something you&#8217;re interested in, anyway.
If you&#8217;ll just walk along a little way with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once outside, Holman kept on out Sixth Street,
and McCray, wondering somewhat, did not demur.</p>

<p>&#8220;McCray, you don&#8217;t know me well,&#8221; Holman
began; &#8220;I&#8217;m an old-timer&mdash;a Has-been, as I overheard
a man say this morning. You&#8217;re a young
man; you come from my district&mdash;or, perhaps, I&#8217;d
better say I come from yours. I came here one session,
just as you have done, from old Jasper, and I
served, in all, four sessions. During that time I
saw a lot of life and of men; I learned a lot, too,
and then I gave it up&mdash;and quit. This morning I
came back for a little holiday, and I strolled over to
the house to see how the old place looked once more,
just as all the Has-beens do; they always manage to
get back, some way or another, every session; it&#8217;s
a habit, a fever, a disease&mdash;get it once, a fellow
never gets over it. Well, this morning, as I stood
there looking around I saw you; and that and one
thing and another reminded me of something. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
saw you sitting there&mdash;young, ambitious, bright,
with the world before you,&mdash;and, well, my boy, I
took a kind of liking for you all of a sudden; but
that&#8217;s neither here nor there. What I was reminded
of, curiously enough, was another young fellow I
used to know years ago&mdash;a fellow that didn&#8217;t look
so much like you, perhaps, and yet who was like you
in many ways.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been, let&#8217;s see, back in the&mdash;well, no
matter, I don&#8217;t exactly recall just now, and it isn&#8217;t
material. But this young fellow came up from
down our way to take his seat for the first time in
the legislature. He was a young lawyer, smart,
good-looking, a fellow every one liked. He had the
gift of the gab; he could make a rattling speech,
was strong on the stump and good before a jury.
Everybody wanted to see him succeed. He was
ambitious&mdash;ambitious as Lincoln, ambitious as the
devil. His ambitions were not selfish&mdash;that is, not
so damned selfish. He was no reformer, nothing
like that; but he really wanted to help his people,
wanted to do something to make life a little easier,
a little better for the average fellow&mdash;like those he
knew back home. He didn&#8217;t have, perhaps, any very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
clear idea how he was going to do this, but he
wanted to do it somehow, and, vaguely enough, I
reckon, he felt that the chance would turn up. Back
home, too, there was a girl&mdash;you got a girl, McCray?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man, startled by the abrupt question,
turned up to Holman, who shambled along a head
taller than he, a face that went red; a smile came to
it, then, suddenly, it went gray and he turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg your pardon,&#8221; said Holman, &#8220;that&#8217;s none of
my business, of course. But this fellow of mine, he
had a girl back there. I knew about it; we were
young members, first term, and he used to tell me
things. And he wanted to marry this girl and make
her happy. He thought, you see, that by being
something, doing something in the world, he could
do <i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were by this time far out Sixth Street, at
the edge of town; a little farther on lay the open
country. They came to a pasture with a broken
fence and a tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s sit down here,&#8221; Holman said, &#8220;and rest,
and I&#8217;ll get on with my story.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat side by side on the bank at the roots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
the elm, and Holman, having finished his cigar and
being a man who seemed to require tobacco in some
form every moment of the day, drew out a long
plug and a knife and cut a piece and put it comfortably
into his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chew?&#8221; he said, proffering tobacco and knife.
McCray shook his head, but lighted a cigarette.
And the old and the new generation sat there side
by side on the bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Interested?&#8221; asked Holman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this young fellow I&#8217;m telling you of&mdash;the
legislature was just a stepping-stone to him; that&#8217;s
what he thought and that&#8217;s what everybody thought;
beyond that were congress, governor, senator, everything.
He went right ahead, was popular and influential,
got good committees, and when he got up to
speak the house grew quiet&mdash;you&#8217;ve seen it that way
yourself&mdash;and he worked and studied, and back
home there was the girl&mdash;and they wanted to get
married. But he was poor&mdash;mighty poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holman leaned over, stretched out his long, thin
arm&mdash;McCray noted the frayed cuffbands&mdash;and
plucked a spear of young grass, pulled the thin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
transparent, whitish-green blade out of its delicate
sheath and, squinting his eyes, examined it minutely,
as if it were the most engrossing object of study in
the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;A legislature, McCray,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;is the
damnedest thing in the world, the rottenest, most
demoralizing, hell-fire sort of institution there is. All
politics is that way, no matter where you find it.
Sometimes I think you can&#8217;t get within forty rows o&#8217;
apple trees of it without being polluted. A man, to
go to a legislature and stay there any time and come
out whole and safe and sound, has to be made of
pure gold. Now, this young friend of mine, he
was, as I&#8217;ve said, all right at heart, and pretty strong,
too, most ways; good family, good blood and all
that; and back home there, in safe surroundings,
he&#8217;d &#8217;ave got along all right till the end. But in the
legislature a fellow&#8217;s away from home, away from
all his customary moorings, and most of the members
get it into their heads that at the capital all the
rules are suspended, and I reckon they are&mdash;that&#8217;s
about what government, as we administer it,
amounts to.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one from home ever shows up there. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
only ones that come around come to get something
for themselves, and it&#8217;s always something they
have no right to and oughtn&#8217;t to have. They come
with all kinds of plausible reasons and lies and
temptations&mdash;damned sneaking, hypocritical, white-washed
sepulchers! Eminent and respectable citizens,
best people and all that! And unless a fellow
has his eyes wide open all the time, has his principles
clear and fixed and knows enough to apply &#8217;em every
minute, knows what a bunco game it all is, and is
of pure gold besides&mdash;as I said&mdash;why, he gets all
tangled up and lost&mdash;yes, lost. It pretty much all
comes from the cities. We poor jays from the
country districts don&#8217;t know anything about the
cities; we take what they tell us, or did in my time.
We think if we just pass a few laws to make our
fellow-citizens in the cities good, regulate their beer
for &#8217;em and all that, that nothing else is required of
us; so these fellows come down from the city and
get us to do their dirty work for them. In those
days there was a fellow here, a lobbyist, a good-looking
man, about the size and favor of&mdash;well, Baldwin
back there&mdash;saw him talking to you this morning&mdash;same
kind of a man exactly, smooth, genial,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
polished, well-dressed, polite, good fellow, and all
that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Baldwin&mdash;I mean the fellow&mdash;well, damn
it!&#8221; Holman suddenly exploded in his exasperation,
&#8220;it <i>was</i> Baldwin! He had a bill he was trying to
pass, a crooked bill, of course, one of those bills like
this street-car bill I heard of to-day, to take something
that by rights belonged to the people of the
city, a street, or the ground under a street, or the air
over a street, or the room in the middle of a street,
and give it to half a dozen eminently respectable and
pious citizens to use for themselves and exploit and
get rich on. Baldwin was trying to pass that bill, and
the session was nearly done, and he needed just one
vote. And he looked around and he settled on this
young friend of mine; he knew his hopes, his wants,
his necessities&mdash;knew all about him, for that&#8217;s Baldwin&#8217;s
business and his way. I needn&#8217;t go into the
details; he worked with him a whole day and nearly
a whole night; explained that it was really a good
thing for the city, that this young fellow&#8217;s constits
were not interested in the city, anyway, didn&#8217;t know
anything about it, nor care anything about it. &#8216;It
can&#8217;t hurt you,&#8217; Baldwin would say. &#8216;Your people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
won&#8217;t know or care; of course, if it was something
they were interested in it might be different&#8217;&mdash;and
all that. And then, finally, &#8217;way in the night, when
the young fellow was worn down in will, and tired
and weak and dazed anyway, Baldwin began to
count the money down on the table, among the stinking
whisky glasses and cigar butts, thousand-dollar
bills, green as that grass there, one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;like
that.&#8221; McCray, with a kind of fascination,
watched Holman as with slow gesture of his long
hands he turned over, as it were, and laid down one
after another those thousand-dollar bills. &#8220;And the
young man fell,&#8221; said Holman at last. And then he
was silent, his gaze fixed afar on some light across
the fields.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Holman resumed, &#8220;Baldwin was right
in one way, at any rate; the people, the young fellow&#8217;s
people down home, didn&#8217;t care. They never
do care; they don&#8217;t take the trouble. They never
knew, anyway, and they elected him again and re-elected
him. And he got married and things seemed
to go along all right with him; you would have said
he was to be envied. But, while nothing seemed to
change outside, something did change inside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
young man; and the worst of it was, it was a change
that he didn&#8217;t know or realize. It was like some
disease, working away, working away there inside
of him, without any pain or any symptoms even; he
had no idea of it. But there it was, working away,
working away. He found, at first, that it was easy
enough to get money, and he got it and he spent it
and it never did him any good, never a bit, neither
him nor his family. Easy money, they call it; but
there&#8217;s no such thing. All money, even easy money,
is hard; you got to pay somehow, you got to pay!</p>

<p>&#8220;He changed by slow degrees; first he got careless
and slovenly in his thoughts, and, after a while,
didn&#8217;t think much anyway, and couldn&#8217;t; he just
talked and talked and talked and made loud speeches&mdash;became
a windbag, a blatherskite, a bore and a
nuisance in the land, to himself and everybody.
There&#8217;s a lot of them in this land; all they need to
make a speech is room enough to work their jaws in.
His old wishes and longings to be of some use in
the world died out of him; he had no aims, no
mark to head for, no place to go. He became ineffectual;
after while all there was to him was that
one vote of his in the house, and by and by that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
wasn&#8217;t worth much; it kept declining in value, he
got cheaper and cheaper, and finally&mdash;just naturally
petered out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, when he was slouchy in morals and mind
and character, he got slouchy in person; his habits
weren&#8217;t bad, perhaps; he was no drunkard or anything
like that, but just&mdash;oh, sloppy, every way.
And his wife, his little wife&mdash;she was a fine, pretty
girl, McCray, when he married her&mdash;she, of course,
had to pay, too, along with him; he dragged her
down. She was patient and kind and always hopeful,
but they were poor, and under the stress of
their necessities he would get peevish and cross, and
sometimes when, say, a Saturday night would come
and there wasn&#8217;t anything in the house to eat&mdash;well,
he&#8217;d look at the children and get mad&mdash;mad at himself,
primarily, though he didn&#8217;t say so or admit it
even to himself&mdash;and he&#8217;d take it out in nasty, mean
ways with her and the children. Finally, she gave
up; she didn&#8217;t know why, she never knew what had
happened, or, if she did, she never even hinted it&mdash;and
the whole family was just going down to hell
and the devil. There wasn&#8217;t any outward tragedy to
make it striking or dramatic or even interesting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>&#8220;And then, after everybody half knew or half
guessed, and had ceased to respect him, he came
back here to Springfield once, as we all do, and happened
to see Baldwin, and found him the same,
scarcely a day older, though he himself was gray
and withered. It hadn&#8217;t hurt Baldwin; he was well-dressed,
respectable, popular, received everywhere&mdash;clubs,
society, church and all, just as the men were
whose dirty money Baldwin handled. And Baldwin&#8217;s
wife, she wasn&#8217;t old and sad and hopeless; she
was going out in society, president of a big woman&#8217;s
club, talked about safe little reforms, charities and
philanthropies. And Baldwin&#8217;s daughters were over
in Europe getting the last finish on their education.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holman had a feeling that McCray was no longer
listening and, glancing aside, saw that McCray&#8217;s
face was buried in his hands. And with pity in
his long, gray face he looked at him a little while,
then laid a hand on McCray&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he said, &#8220;why I told you this
story? You see, I didn&#8217;t want to make you feel
bad; I only wanted to show you. Because there&#8217;s
a lot in you&mdash;a big, beautiful future.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t say that,&#8221; cried McCray. &#8220;All but
that last&mdash;all but that last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s too late. Oh, Holman, it&#8217;s too late&mdash;too
late! If it were only yesterday! But now&mdash;it&#8217;s
too late!&#8221;</p>

<p>And McCray bent forward, bowed in pain, and
wept.</p>

<p>Holman waited until the boy&#8217;s grief subsided, and
then, by degrees, he got the story. To McCray it
was an irreclaimable and tragic wreck of life. But
to Holman, in the broader vision his own sins had
made possible, and in some of his judgments of men,
perhaps too broad&mdash;if, indeed, that may be&mdash;the
case was not at all hopeless. He had not, it is true,
been prepared for a revelation so complete and damaging,
but it presented to him no irrevocable aspect.
McCray, with the proclivity of youth to fixed and
fated facts, saw the thing consummated and complete,
the contract wholly executed; but Holman did
not regard it as even executory, and he cited for
McCray the old adage about the bad bargain.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll just give the stuff back to Baldwin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Holman stoutly, &#8220;afterward. After
the vote; we&#8217;ll have that satisfaction. Keep him
on the hooks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said McCray. &#8220;But here, you take it.
It&mdash;burns&mdash;&#8221; He gave to Holman a roll of bills,
and sighed in relief. &#8220;You have saved me,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;you have saved my soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, to hell with your soul!&#8221; Holman said, with
more orthodoxy than he was accustomed to evince.
He was not sufficiently accustomed to the highly
moral to relish its too bald expression; perhaps his
experience had been of one other as yet unrecognized
benefit&mdash;it had made him wholesomely afraid
of cant, and whatever good his spiritual adventure
of that day had done, or was to do him, he was in
little danger of becoming a Pharisee.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Greggerson, the clerk of the house, in shirt-sleeves,
a handkerchief stuffed into his collar, had
himself taken the reading-desk that night. Above
him the speaker, bent forward, watched the proceedings
like some bird of prey, smiting his desk
sharply with his gavel now and then, or pointing it
fiercely at some one. Above the speaker, in placid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
folds, was the flag, and from their large canvases
on either side of the house, Lincoln and Douglas
surveyed the scene from the calm altitude of their
secure place in American statesmanship.</p>

<p>When the bill had come over from the senate half
an hour before, the crowd had rushed over with it,
burst into the house and pushed down the aisle,
choking the passage. Holman saw several senators
come over to see the end; he saw the governor&#8217;s
private secretary, and old Benson, the governor&#8217;s
political manager, and&mdash;Baldwin, suave and bland
as usual, yet, as Holman could see on a second closer
look, intensely anxious and concerned. He was paler
than Holman had ever seen him. The air of the
chamber was hot and fetid; there was a low, ominous
grumbling. Dalby was on his feet on the Republican
side, Quinn on the Democratic&mdash;the program
under Baldwin&#8217;s eye and the speaker&#8217;s would
be hurried through. In the curious way in which secrets
cease to be secrets and permeate the mind of
the mass, it was generally known how every man
would vote, and it was understood that the climax,
somehow, would come with the calling of the name
of McCray, of Jasper. The roll-call moved slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
on down the alphabet; Greggerson&#8217;s voice resounded;
its boom could have been heard through
open windows three blocks away:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lyendorf!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lynn, of Sangamon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lynn, of Vermilion!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;McBroom!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;McCoy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;McCray!&#8221;</p>

<p>Holman strained forward with the crowd.
McCray hesitated, looked up, then shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sharp volley of applause, a clapping
of hands which had in it perhaps, a certain too self-righteous
quality; and there were human groans
and hoots, and at his elbow Holman heard an oath
and turned to face Baldwin. The face of the lobbyist
was white with rage and moist with fine globules
of perspiration, and there were revealed to Holman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
in the brilliant, new illuminations of that moment
certain lines that once had not been there, lines not
drawn by age, and Holman saw them with a fierce,
vindictive joy.</p>

<p>But McCray was coming, battling his way down
the aisle, escaping the congratulations, curses,
praises, objurgations of the men who crowded about
him. He got away from them and came back, and,
as he took Holman&#8217;s hand, his tired, drawn face was
touched with a smile. Baldwin, there beside them,
saw it, stared at Holman incredulously and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be damned!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Holman had no attention for Baldwin then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get out of this,&#8221; he said to McCray.</p>

<p>And when, out of that weltering chaos, they
found themselves in the rotunda, in the mysterious
semi-gloom that filled its great, inverted bowl, the
gloom which all the electric lights could not wholly
dissipate, Holman quickly drew his hand from his
pocket, pressed it into McCray&#8217;s, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, this belongs to&mdash;&#8221; Holman hesitated, as
at a new point in ethics.</p>

<p>&#8220;To Baldwin,&#8221; said McCray. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he went on
wearily, &#8220;I&#8217;ll give it back to him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;To think of an old Has-been like me,&#8221; said Holman,
&#8220;that hasn&#8217;t seen so much easy money in a
coon&#8217;s age&mdash;and to go toting it around all day in his
pocket! McCray, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m getting too damned
civic! I&#8217;ll be a reformer next, and back in politics!&#8221;
He laughed again. &#8220;We&#8217;ll wait here a little. Baldwin&#8217;ll
be along, and I&#8217;ll stay and see you safely
through it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldwin was coming even then, and in a moment
espied them there by the rail. He had recovered
himself; the mask of years could not be lowered
long; he came on leisurely, even pausing to light a
cigarette. Holman hailed him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost out, didn&#8217;t you, George?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it seems,&#8221; Baldwin replied. &#8220;When you do
business on honor you must expect to be betrayed
once in a while. It&#8217;s all in the game. But where do
you come in, Jim&mdash;an old back number like you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does seem funny, doesn&#8217;t it? An old Has-been
like me! Well, I saw a good thing coming off and
I declared myself in. But McCray has a little business
with you, and when you&#8217;re through with him,
maybe I can make it plain to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I have no further business with Mr. McCray.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
I&#8217;m quite through with <i>him</i>.&#8221; And he turned his
back deliberately on the young man.</p>

<p>McCray bit his lip, then remembered and became
humble, and, putting forth his hand, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&mdash;here&#8217;s your&mdash;money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldwin turned, took the money, thrust it carelessly
into his pocket, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t count it here, of course. I <i>presume</i> it&#8217;s
all there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Holman, &#8220;it&#8217;s all there. Such work
is done on honor, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; Baldwin delicately drew on his
cigarette, blew the smoke upward. &#8220;But&mdash;that question,
Jim, that one unanswered question. Where do
you come in? What is there in this for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Holman looked at him from top to toe with a
long, cold, steady gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, George,&#8221; he began slowly, &#8220;for me there&#8217;s
nothing in it, in the way you think&mdash;in the only
terms you can think in, I mean. There is, however,
in another way, a lot in it; a lot I haven&#8217;t dreamed of
for years. All day, while arranging and planning
this&mdash;the idea came to me suddenly this morning&mdash;I&#8217;ve
been looking forward to this moment, thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
of what I&#8217;d say and what satisfaction I&#8217;d have in
saying it. I thought that that satisfaction would
pay me for all you&#8217;ve done&mdash;for all you&#8217;ve tried to
do to this boy here&mdash;for all&mdash;no, damn it! not for
all!&mdash;all hell and eternity couldn&#8217;t pay you for <i>all</i>
you&#8217;ve done&mdash;to other boys like him. But now, as
I look at your face and study it, I see that you just
couldn&#8217;t understand, that&#8217;s all; you have lost the
ability to understand&mdash;and&mdash;well, George, that mere
fact will pay you, so I won&#8217;t try to say it. I&#8217;ll say
only good-by, and when you get home to that wife
and those daughters of yours&mdash;just remember that
Jim Holman asked you how you could look them in
the eyes. Do that and maybe&mdash;you&#8217;ll understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldwin stared at him; the mask shifted an
instant, then, instantly restored, he turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks old, after all,&#8221; said Holman. &#8220;It has
changed him, too....&#8221; He drew out his watch.
&#8220;I can catch that midnight train on the Alton. I&#8217;m
going to get out of here now; I&#8217;m going home to
old Jasper. There&#8217;s a little woman there I want to
see, a little woman and some children, and I&#8217;m
going home&mdash;now, at last, to look them in the eyes.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">WHAT WILL BECOME
OF ANNIE?</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SPRING had come back to Leadam Street. The
moist cobblestones had steamed in the new sun
all the afternoon; sparrows were sweeping up to the
eaves, trailing strings and long straws after them;
from the back porches of the flats were loud, awaking,
tinny sounds, breaking the long silence. The
clank of the cable-cars was borne over the roofs,
clearly now in the damp, heavy atmosphere; from
somewhere came the jingle of a street piano. Floating
down the mild afternoon, came the deep, mellow
note of some big propeller, loosing her winter moorings
at last and rousing to greet the tug that would
tow her out of the narrow river. Kelley, the policeman,
strolled along the sidewalk, with his hands
locked behind him, his nose in the air, sniffing
eagerly and pleasurably. He had left off his skirted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
overcoat, and changed his clumsy cap for his helmet.</p>

<p>Annie had sat at her window all the afternoon,
but, as the spring day wore toward its close, she
began to realize that only the melancholy, and none
of the promise of this first spring day had touched
her. She had thrown open the window, to test the
quality of the air. Now and then a warm breath
came wandering in off the prairies, though when it
met the cold, persistent wind from the lake, it hesitated,
and timidly turned back. But Annie would
not let herself doubt that the spring had come. She
knew that in time the prairie wind would woo its
way until it would be playing with the waves of the
lake itself, the little waves that danced all day, blue
and white, in the sunshine. And then the summer
would come, and on Sunday afternoons Jimmy
would take her out to Lincoln Park, and they would
have their supper at Fisher&#8217;s Garden.</p>

<p>Leadam Street was dull enough on week days; on
Sundays it was wholly mournful.</p>

<p>Once Annie saw a woman, with a shawl over her
head and a tin bucket in her hand, go into Englehardt&#8217;s
place, down the street. The woman went in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
furtively, and brushed hastily through the &#8220;Family
Entrance,&#8221; though why could not be told. She went
there nearly every hour of every day. Then Annie
was left alone. She did not turn inward to the flat;
that was too still and lonesome, and it was growing
dark now, as the shadows gathered. She heard the
strenuous gongs of the cable-cars over in State
Street, and she could imagine the crowds, gay from
their Sunday holiday, that filled them, clinging even
to the running-boards. She might have gone out
and been with them, as every one else in the street
seemed to have done, but she would not for worlds
have been away from home when Jimmy came. She
heard the jingle of the street piano, too; she wished
it would come down that way. She would gladly
have emptied her purse for the Dago.</p>

<p>It was not unusual for Annie to be left alone, and
she had grown used to it&mdash;almost; as used as a
woman can&mdash;even the wife of a politician. Jimmy
had told her that she must not worry at any of his
absences; an alderman could never tell what might
detain him. She had but a vague notion of the
things that might detain an alderman, though she
had no doubt of their importance. At times she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
thought she felt an intimate little charm in the importance
that thus reflected itself upon her, but,
nevertheless, her heart was never quite easy until
she heard Jimmy&#8217;s step on the stair and his key in
the latch, and then&mdash;joy came to the little flat, and
stayed there, trembling and fearful, until he went
away again. She had grown to be so dependent on
Jimmy. Ever since she had been graduated from
the convent his great, strong personality had stood
between her and the world, so that, as her girlhood
had merged into womanhood, she had hardly recognized
the change, and she remained a girl still,
alone but for him; he was her whole life. She had
doubted his entrance into politics at first, just as
she had doubted his going into the saloon business,
though she scarcely understood either in their various
significances. Father Daugherty had told her
she was a fortunate girl to have Jimmy for a husband,
and that had been enough. Her only objection
was that politics seemed to keep Jimmy away
from home oftener than the old work in the packing-house
used to; she had trembled at it at times,
and at times had grown a little frightened. His
success in politics had pleased her, of course, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
made her proud, but it could not have made her
prouder of him than she had been. He was all-sufficient
for her; no change could make any difference....
Without Jimmy, what could she have
done? He had never been gone so long before;
here it was Sunday evening; he had left at eleven
o&#8217;clock Saturday morning; there was to be an extra
session of the council Saturday night, an unusual
thing, and she had not been surprised when she
awoke to find that it was Sunday morning&mdash;and that
Jimmy had not come.</p>

<p>The morning wore away, and she had made all
the arrangements for the dinner she would have
awaiting him. She had gone about lightly, happily,
all the day, singing to herself, the gladness of the
new spring in her. But, one by one, all the tasks
she could think of were performed, even to drawing
the water for his bath and laying out his clean linen.
And then, when there was nothing else to do but
wait, and nothing with which to beguile her waiting,
she had taken her post at the window to watch for
his cab.</p>

<p>The day waned, the Sunday drew wearily toward
its close, as if it sighed for Monday, and the resumption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
of active life. The street grew stiller and
stiller. She heard the voice of a newsboy, far out
of his usual haunts, crying an extra. She could
not distinguish the words in which he bawled his
tidings, and she thought nothing of it. One of
Jimmy&#8217;s few rules was that she was not to read the
papers. But, when the heavy voice was gone, she
found that it had had a strange, depressing effect
upon her; she longed for Jimmy to come; the day
had dragged itself by so slowly, and something of
its somberness had stolen into her soul. She sighed,
and leaned her chin on her arm; her back was growing
tired, and beginning to ache. Then suddenly
she heard horses&#8217; hoofs, and the roll of a carriage
in the street. She rose and leaned far out of the
window to welcome him. The cab drew up; it
stopped; the door opened. But the man who got out
was not Jimmy. It was Father Daugherty. She
knew him the instant she saw the fuzzy old high
hat thrust out of the cab, and caught the greenish
sheen of the shabby cassock that stood away from
the fringe of white hair on his neck in such an ill-fitting,
ill-becoming fashion. The old man did not
look up, but tottered across the sidewalk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>Annie gasped, and scarce could move. In a moment
more she heard the old steps on the stairs, the
steps that for forty years had gone on so many errands
for others, kind and merciful errands all of
them, though for the most part sad. He was soon beside
her, and she looked up into the gentle face that
was so full of the woes of humanity. He had driven
at once from the hospital in the cab they had sent to
fetch him. Jimmy&#8217;s last words had been:</p>

<p>&#8220;What will become of Annie?&#8221;</p>

<p>The death of Alderman Jimmy Tiernan at any
time would have been a shock. When death came
to him by a pistol-ball it created what the newspapers,
in the columns they were so glad to fill that
Monday morning, defined as a profound sensation.
This sensation was most profound in two circles
in the city, outwardly unconnected, though bound
by ties which it was the constant and earnest effort
of both to keep secret and unknown.</p>

<p>The city council had had a special session on Saturday
night, and had passed the new gas franchise.
Alderman Tiernan had had charge of the fight. Malachi
Nolan was away, and Baldwin had picked out
Tiernan as the most trustworthy and able of those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the gang who were left behind. Jimmy had felt the
compliment, and gloried in it. It was the biggest
thing that had fallen to him in his political life, and
he was determined that he would make all there was
to be made out of the opportunity. Not in any base
or sordid sense&mdash;that is, not wholly so; that would
come, of course, but he felt beyond this a joy in his
work; the satisfaction of mere success would be his
chief reward, the glory and the professional pride he
would feel. He relished the fight against the newspapers,
against &#8220;public opinion,&#8221; whatever that was;
against the element that called itself the &#8220;better&#8221;
element.</p>

<p>He was fully determined that no step should
be misplaced; he counted his men over and over
again; he checked them off mentally, and it all
turned out as he had said. Every one was present,
every one voted, and voted &#8220;right,&#8221; when the roll
was called; the new gas franchise was granted;
Jimmy had delivered the goods.</p>

<p>It was natural that such a glorious victory should
be celebrated, and the gang, when it assembled in
Jimmy&#8217;s place, immediately after the session was
over, could not restrain its impatience. The boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
longed to have the fruits of the day&#8217;s work; with
their wages they could celebrate with glad, care-free
hearts. But Jimmy was of a Gaelic cunning. He
would not jeopardize the victory at that stage by
any indiscretion. He saw at a glance the mood the
gang was in. He smiled, as he always smiled&mdash;and
any one, to see his smile, must have loved him&mdash;but
he shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;The drink&#8217;s in you, boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and you
can&#8217;t trust your tongues. You&#8217;ll have to wait.
Monday night you&#8217;ll be over. Then we&#8217;ll talk business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Subconsciously, they still were sober; in a strange
dual mentality they saw the safety there was in his
decision; and, in the paralysis of will his magnetism
worked in them, they loved him the more for it.
They remembered that it was just what Malachi
would have done. And so, noisy and excited as
they were, they applauded his sagacity. Then they
gave themselves over unreservedly to their appetites.
It was a famous night in the annals of the gang.
Jimmy himself joined in the revelry. And in the
calm, silent Sunday morning, with the new sunlight
of spring glaring in his swollen, aching eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
he found himself, with a companion, in a Clark
Street chop house. Just as they were going to order
breakfast, a young man came in, with a black look
in his eyes. No one saw it then, though they all
remembered it afterward. Jimmy greeted him as
gaily as he greeted everybody, but the young man
did not warm to Jimmy&#8217;s greeting. There were
words, the quick rush of anger to Jimmy&#8217;s face, a
blow, and the pistol shot. At first the newspapers
were glad to trace some sinister connection between
the franchise fight and the tragedy. Afterward,
they said it was only some private grudge. No one
dreamed that Jimmy Tiernan had an enemy on
earth.</p>

<p>At the hospital, Jimmy opened his eyes, and on
his face, grown very white, there was a smile again,
the last of his winning smiles. His friends were
with him, and they wept, unashamed. Then he rolled
his head on his pillow, and spoke of Annie. The
calm Sister of Charity pressed her rosary into his
hand, and stooped to listen. They had just time to
send for Father Daugherty.</p>

<p>Down in the ward, the sadness that had come
to Leadam Street spread blackly. Many a man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
and many a woman, and many a child, cried. The
poor had lost a friend, and they would not soon
forget him. In the long days of the distant winter
they would think of him over and over. Every one
in that ward was poor, though the reformers, condescending
that way whenever Jimmy was up for
re&euml;lection, somehow never grasped the real significance
of the fact. And it was a somber Monday
around the city hall. Jimmy had been a man with
a genius for friendship. The gang mourned him in
a sadness that had added to it the remorse of a
recent sobriety, but their grief, genuine as it was,
had in it an evil bitterness their hearts would not
have owned. They were restive and troubled.
Whenever they got together in little groups, they
read consternation in one another&#8217;s faces, and now
and then they cursed the caution they had extolled
on Saturday night. Besides these varied effects, Jimmy&#8217;s
death, while it could not create a crisis in the
market, nevertheless gave rise to nervous feelings
in certain segments of financial circles. It was
inevitable that financial and political circles should
overlap and intersect each other in this matter, and
there were conferences which seemed to reflect a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
sense of personal resentment at Jimmy for having
been murdered so inopportunely. In the end, the
financiers were peremptory with Baldwin. He must
fix the thing some way. And he assured them that
he would give the appointment of the administrator
his immediate attention. Already, he said, he had
a man in view who would be reasonable and practical.
There were suggestions of strong-handed
methods, but that was never George R. Baldwin&#8217;s
way. He went out with his air of affability unimpaired.
Meanwhile, political and financial circles
could only wait and hope.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The excitement of the first few days following
the tragedy kept Annie&#8217;s mind occupied; but, when
the funeral was over, and she returned to her little
flat, when the neighborly women had at last gone
back to their homes and their interrupted duties,
and the world to its work, Annie was left to face
life alone. She could not adjust herself to the
change, and fear and despair added their blackness
to her grief. Father Daugherty knew how great a
blow Jimmy&#8217;s death would be to her, and, though
he gave what comfort he could, he left her grief to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
time. He did not belong to the preaching orders.
But, as he pondered in his wise old head, he
shrewdly guessed that the careless Jimmy would
hardly have made provision against anything so
far from his thoughts as death, and he perceived
that if Annie were to be protected from a future
with which she, alone and unaided, would hardly
have the capacity to deal, some one must act.</p>

<p>Long ago might Father Daugherty have celebrated
his silver jubilee as pastor of St. Patrick&#8217;s,
but he was not the man for celebrations. The parish
was one big family to him, and he knew the
joys and sorrows, the little hopes and pathetic ambitions
of every one in it. The sorrows of his children
he bore in his own heart; they had wrought
their complex and tragic tale in his face. The joys
he left them to taste alone; but he found too much
sorrow to have time for joy. During all those
years, he had given himself unsparingly; if it was
all he had to give, it was the most precious thing
he could have given&mdash;a daily sacrifice that exhausted
a temperament keenly sensitive and sympathetic. So
he had grown old and white before his time. Many
a man had he kept straight when times were hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
and the right to work denied him; many a widow
had he saved from the wiles of the claim-agent.
The corporations and the lawyers hated him.</p>

<p>And so, on Monday morning, the clerks of the
probate court had scarcely had time to yawn reluctantly
before beginning a new week&#8217;s work, when
Father Daugherty appeared to file Annie&#8217;s waiver
of her own right to be appointed administratrix of
the estate of James Tiernan, deceased, with an application
for the appointment, instead, of Francis
Daugherty as administrator.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must keep a set of blanks,&#8221; whispered one
clerk to another.</p>

<p>As Father Daugherty went about his inventory,
he saw that the result would be what he had expected.
Jimmy had left no estate, no insurance,
nothing but the saloon. And that, with Jimmy dead,
was nothing, for its value lay all in Jimmy&#8217;s personality
and the importance of his position in politics.
The fixtures would hardly pay for the burying of
him. When the debts the law prefers had been paid,
Annie would have scarce a penny. The world
might preserve a respectful and sympathetic attitude
during the few exciting days when it was paying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
its last conventional tributes to the dead man, but
it kept itemized accounts meanwhile, and it could
not long pretend to have forgotten material things.
It would present its bills, and they must be paid.
Annie would have hardly a cent to meet them with.
And Father Daugherty knew, even if Annie did
not know, what the world would do then.</p>

<p>Yet he smiled, though he shook his head, as he
thought of the free-handed, indiscriminating generosity
that had been akin to the improvidence of
Jimmy&#8217;s nature. And now he had but one more
duty to perform; the safe in Jimmy&#8217;s saloon had
not been opened. No one, not even the bartender,
knew the combination, and Father Daugherty had a
locksmith to drill the lock. The gang had attended
Jimmy&#8217;s funeral in black neckties, and had mourned
him sincerely, but, now that he was buried, their
attitude became the common worldly attitude, with
perhaps a little more than the usual aggressiveness
in it. They were in a quandary as to the bundle in
the new gas franchise, and many conferences
with Baldwin had nerved them to desperate
expedients. So it was on Baldwin&#8217;s advice that
they determined to be represented at the opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
of the safe. Two of the number were detailed to
this duty, McQuirk of the Ninth, and Bretzenger of
the Twenty-fourth. When they made their demand
on Father Daugherty, explaining that they came in
their capacity as Jimmy&#8217;s nearest friends, he
assented with a readiness that relieved them both,
and delighted Bretzenger, though McQuirk, who
knew Father Daugherty better than his colleague
did, was fearful and suspicious. Father Daugherty
said that he had thought of having witnesses, and
they would serve as well as any. It was very kind
of them.</p>

<p>The priest and the two aldermen waited in the
saloon for two hours while the locksmith drilled
away silently. The street door was closed; the
crape still hung from the handle that had never gone
unlatched so long at a time before, the curtains were
drawn, and outside the crowds for ever shuffled by
on the sidewalk, all oblivious to the little drama of
hopes and fears that was unfolding its cross-purposes
within. The saloon was dark, and an electric
bulb glowed to shed light for the locksmith. The
two aldermen puffed their cigars in silence, save for
an occasional whisper, one with another. Father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Daugherty&#8217;s gaunt form leaned against the dusty
bar, strangely out of keeping with such a scene,
though the saloons in his parish knew him, especially
on Saturday nights, when he conducted little raids
of his own, and turned his prisoners over to their
wives. Now his weary visage was relaxed in patient
waiting. At last the locksmith dropped his tools,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221;</p>

<p>The thick steel doors swung out on their noiseless
hinges. The two aldermen sprang to the side of
the safe. The priest drew near slowly, but his little
eyes were turned on the aldermen, and they fell back
a pace. Then the priest&#8217;s long figure sank to a kneeling
posture, and he peered into the safe. There was
nothing in view. It was strangely empty, for a safe
of its monstrous size and mystery, and the tenacity
of its combination. He thrust in his hand and fumbled
through all its hollow interior, and then he drew
forth&mdash;a soiled linen collar! It was ludicrous, and
for once he laughed, a little laugh. There was not a
ledger, not a book.</p>

<p>&#8220;He kept no accounts, your riverence,&#8221; said McQuirk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;It was just like him,&#8221; said Father Daugherty.
But he kept on with his search. And, when he
opened the little drawer of maplewood, he found a
parcel, done snugly up in thick brown paper. He
tore it open, and there swelled into his sight packages
of bank-notes almost bursting in their yellow
paper straps. The bills were new, and as freshly
green as the spring itself; more tempting thus, some
way, to the reluctant conscience. The two aldermen
bent over the black, stooping figure of the priest,
their eyes fixed on the money. There it was at last,
the bundle itself, the price of, or a part of the price
of the new gas franchise. The priest straightened
painfully, and got to his feet. He held the bundle in
his thin fingers, and glanced at his witnesses, with a
keen and curious eye. They met his gaze, expectant,
eager, drawing dry, hot breaths. Involuntarily, they
extended their hands. Father Daugherty looked at
them, and a little twinkle of amusement showed in
the eyes that were wontedly so mild and sad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The two aldermen hastily raised their hands, and
together, in strange unison, wiped their brows. The
room had suddenly grown hot for them, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
brows were wet, though Father Daugherty was cool
and composed, as he ever was. Yet they remembered;
they could not so easily give up; it was theirs
by every right. They could have cursed Jimmy just
then for his excessive caution. It was McQuirk&#8217;s
quick mind that thought first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe there&#8217;s writing,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Father Daugherty looked long and thoroughly,
running his thin hand deep into pigeon-holes and
back into the partitions, until the sleeves of his
shabby coat were pushed far up his lean wrist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a scrap,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, maybe&mdash;&#8221; But McQuirk drew Bretzenger
away, and they went into the darkness that lay thick
as dust in the back of the long room. Meanwhile,
Father Daugherty searched the safe through and
through. He found nothing more. The strong-box
had had but one purpose, and it had served it well.
Then slowly, painfully, with the clumsy, unaccustomed
fingers that had had small chance to count
money, he turned the packages over, counting them
carefully, wetting his trembling fingers now and
then. The man who had drilled the safe stood looking
on, with eyes that widened more and more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>&#8220;How much is there, Father?&#8221; he said, at length.
He extended a grimy forefinger hesitatingly, as if to
touch the package the priest balanced on his palm.
But he did not touch it, any more than if it had been
something sacred in that clean, sacerdotal hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty thousand,&#8221; the priest answered. His
voice was a trifle husky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty thousand!&#8221; the man exclaimed. And
then he added, in awe: &#8220;Dollars! Doesn&#8217;t look like
that much, does it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Father Daugherty answered. He had been
a little surprised himself. There was something disappointing
in the size of the package. He had never
seen so much money before, and its tremendous
power, its tremendous power for evil, as he suddenly
thought, was concentrated in a compass so
small that the mind could but slowly wheel about to
the new conception. The locksmith spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might I&mdash;might I&mdash;hold it a second&mdash;in my own
hand?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The priest gave the bundle into the hand hardened
by so much honest toil. The man held it, heaving it
up and down incredulously, testing its weight. Then
he gave it back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he said, and sighed.</p>

<p>The two aldermen had returned from their little
conference.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your riverence,&#8221; began McQuirk hesitatingly,
&#8220;might we have a word with you&mdash;in private?&#8221; He
looked suspiciously at the workman. The priest went
with them a little way apart.</p>

<p>&#8220;We know about that,&#8221; McQuirk pointed to the
bundle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do, do you?&#8221; said the priest sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Father,&#8221; Bretzenger said. &#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;well,
it belongs to the company, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What company?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you know, the new ga&mdash;ah, that is, Mr.
Baldwin, the lawyer. You know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;George R.?&#8221; asked Father Daugherty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your riverence,&#8221; said both men hopefully.
&#8220;It should go back to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest looked at them, and they caught again
that amused expression in his face. It put them ill at
ease, and it roused resentment in Bretzenger, who
felt that this calm priest could read him too well.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of it belongs to you, then, I suppose?&#8221; observed
Father Daugherty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>&#8220;Ah, well&mdash;of course,&#8221; McQuirk urged, and his
tone showed that he was trying, in his crude way,
to impress the priest with an honest disinterestedness.
&#8220;Of course, Jimmy was entitled to his piece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; Bretzenger said, swelling with the little
virtue he had found to help him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you say it ought to go back to Baldwin, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we think, sir,&#8221; they chimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he can come and identify it,&#8221; said Father
Daugherty. He slowly wrapped the package up, and,
unbuttoning his long, rusty coat a little way down
from the throat, stuffed the money into an inner
pocket. The deed seemed to madden Bretzenger,
and he moved a step forward. The two others saw
his motion. The priest did not move, but he turned
a look on them, and raised his hand, and McQuirk
quailed, a superstitious fear in his eyes. He stiffened
his arm before Bretzenger, and stayed him. And
then the priest stepped quietly to the safe, and pushed
its door to with an arm that seemed too weak and
frail to stir the heavy steel.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks to me, Michael,&#8221; he was saying gently,
as if addressing McQuirk alone, &#8220;like personal
property, and, as I&#8217;m the administrator, I suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
I&#8217;ll have to take charge of it. If any beside our dead
friend own it, let them come forward and prove their
claim, and identify their property in open court.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father Daugherty reported the whole affair to the
probate court, and the judge when the time for filing
claims had elapsed, and he had waited for the particular
claim he knew would not be presented, ordered
a distribution of the property. Then Father
Daugherty went to the flat to see Annie, bearing the
bundle, the original bundle, the bundle that had
bought the new gas franchise. Something of the
dramatic quality in the situation had got into the old
priest&#8217;s heart. He knew that Annie would appreciate
it all so much better if she could see the
fortune, and feel it, and he would let her do so for
an instant before he put it away in the safety deposit
vaults to await opportunity for its investment.</p>

<p>She looked at it long and long, lying there in the
lap of her black gown. She could not grasp the
amount, though the old priest, leaning forward, with
the enthusiasm of a boy shining once more, after so
many years, in his hollow eyes, said over and over:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at it, my child! Feel it! It&#8217;s fifty thousand
dollars! And it&#8217;s all yours!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>She patted it, tenderly and affectionately, with a
soft and reminiscent caress, so that the priest knew
that it was not for anything that package of money
might hold for her in a material way, then or afterward,
but rather for what it gave back for a moment
to her desolated heart. And the priest was
glad of that, and thereafter silent. He had had
doubts. He would feel better when the money had
passed out of his hands, and he sometimes questioned
whether it would ever do good in any one&#8217;s hands.
But he had a sense of humor, too, a grim sense in
this instance, when he thought of certain political
and financial circles, even if he did dust his thin
hands carefully with his spotless handkerchief when
he laid the money down.</p>

<p>Annie&#8217;s eyes had filled with the ready tears that
welled to their sweeping, black lashes, and trembled
there as she raised her eyes to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Father,&#8221; she said, &#8220;he was so, <i>so</i> good to me,
always&mdash;and so kind! And see how thoughtful he
was&mdash;to leave me all this! Oh, Jimmy, my poor
Jimmy!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she rocked forward, like an old woman, and
wept.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE VINDICATION OF
HENDERSON OF GREENE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">BALDWIN, the lobbyist, leaning forward with
his elbows on his knees, and swaying with the
train as it swung out on to the rocky ledge that paves
the Valley of the Desplaines, contemplatively cut the
end from a fresh cigar and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not so sure, after all. My experience
with the Bailey bill shook my faith in that proposition.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two other men in the salon looked up with
startled eyes.</p>

<p>Baldwin had been driven over from his Michigan
Avenue home and caught the Alton Limited when it
made the station stop at Twenty-third Street, where
he boarded the last of its curtained Pullmans. This
coach was the political institution known to Illinois
statesmanship as the Springfield sleeper, and Baldwin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
and his two companions, Jennings, the secretary
of state, and Denny Healy, a canal commissioner,
had the capsulated coziness of its smoking
compartment all to themselves. Down by Dwight
they had fallen into a desultory discussion of the
old question as to whether or not every man has his
price. The question could hardly interest these men
long, for, after many years&#8217; constant contemplation,
under the gray dome of the state house, of the weaknesses
of men, they had come to an acceptance of
the doctrine now grown frank enough to have no
lingering taint of cynicism. Jennings, indeed, had
just dismissed the subject by declaring:</p>

<p>&#8220;All men aire fer sale, an&#8217; most of &#8217;em damn
cheap.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the subject might have lapsed had it not
been for Baldwin&#8217;s heterodoxy. That George R.
Baldwin of all men should doubt the first maxim
of their profession was beyond comprehension.
Though he played his part in life with a suite of law
offices in a skyscraper as a background, his serious
business was lobbying bills through the legislature.
His friends, who were many, boasted that he always
stood by them, right or wrong. Which he did, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
and as they were generally wrong, the value
of such friendship, or his opinions on practical politics,
could hardly be overestimated. The day had
been a hot one in Chicago, but now a cold draft
of smoky air was sucking in through the narrow
window-screen, on which the cinders hailed as the
Limited plunged southward.</p>

<p>Smoke and dirt had long since begrimed the dark
and sweaty face of Jennings, who, with waistcoat
opened in the comfort dear to the Egyptian, was
sprawling his shanks on the cushion opposite him,
while Healy, doomed by corpulence to an attitude
more erect, sitting with his chubby knees far apart,
as the fat will, his paunch resting on the edge of the
seat he filled, now and then brushed a fat palm over
his red scalp and sighed, as he puffed his domestic
cigar. But Baldwin sat and smiled, showing his
excellent teeth beneath his reddish mustache, and
visibly expanded. They could hear, as an undertone
to their talking, the dull roll of the Pullman&#8217;s paper
wheels, and now and then they were interrupted by
the whistle&#8217;s long and lonesome note at a country
road-crossing. Out through the double windows,
against which Healy sometimes pressed his forehead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
because the glass cooled it, the dark fields
wheeled past in an endless belt of blackness, save
where an occasional bunch of sparks from the engine
burrowed under the right-of-way fence, and
then, in the momentary glow of light, they could
catch sight of a tossing plume of corn, which told
them they were out on the prairies of central Illinois.</p>

<p>When the train paused for the Big Four crossing
at Gardner, they heard in the sudden flood of silence
the snoring of a sensible fare-paying passenger who
had gone to bed. The strident noise of the crickets
and the frogs outside was noted only as an effect of
the silence. The three men had no thought of retiring
until they reached Pontiac at two o&#8217;clock, for the
lives they led were such that they could not sleep
until that hour, and then not very well.</p>

<p>Baldwin had lighted his imported cigar, the superior
aroma of which, perceptible even in an atmosphere
choked with coal gases and the fumes of
the domestic cigars Jennings and Healy were smoking,
indicated faintly the height of cultivation to
which he had brought his appetites, when Jennings,
flecking his ashes on the floor of the salon just as he
would have done on his own parlor carpet, said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;Well, go on with the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldwin settled his chin over the blue cravat with
the white polka dots that was knotted over the immaculate
collar&mdash;a collar, incredulous men from
southern Illinois were sometimes told, that was actually
made on the shirt&mdash;drew his creased trousers
a little farther above the tops of his patent leather
boots, and began:</p>

<p>&#8220;One session there was an old man named Henderson
in the house, who had come up from Greene
County; Henderson of Greene, everybody called
him, to distinguish him from Tom Henderson, of
Effingham. He was a queer figure, was Henderson
of Greene, tall and gaunt, with a stoop in his shoulders.
He always wore a hickory shirt, opened at a
red and wrinkled throat, and his hair was just a
stubble bleached by harvest suns. The old man was
a riddle to everybody in Springfield that winter. He
was always in his seat, even on Monday evenings,
when no one else was there. He voted always with his
party, and he voted consistently as well, like a good
country member, against all the Chicago legislation.
But he was a silent man, who stood apart from his
fellows, looking with eyes that peered from under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
his shaggy, sunburned brows with an expression no
one could fathom. He never made a speech, he never
introduced a bill, he never offered a resolution, he
never even presented a petition, and when the
speaker made his committee assignments, he placed
the old man on the committees on History, Geology
and Science, and on Civil Service Reform, and he
did not even look disappointed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two politicians chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for me,&#8221; continued Baldwin, &#8220;I never spoke
to him, and never knew any one who did. The
speaker himself only addressed him&mdash;and then as
the gentleman from Greene&mdash;when they were verifying
roll-calls. No one ever knew where he
boarded. The herd book gave him a paragraph, saying
that he had been born in Indiana along in &#8217;37,
and moved to this state sometime in the fifties. Left
an orphan early, with no education, he had been a
day laborer all his life, working at anything he could
get, mostly on farms. He never had held office before,
and none knew how he broke into the legislature&mdash;the
tidal wave, I suppose. Every one knew he
never would come back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we got down to the last night of the session.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
The hands of the clock had been turned back
in that vain old attempt to stay the remorseless
hours, but its pale and impassive face was impotent
as a gravestone to stay dissolution and oblivion. I
know men who would have spent a fortune to give
that legislature one day more of life, but it was
sweeping on to its midnight death. Somehow, whenever
I think of the legislature, I think of <i>that</i> legislature,
and whenever my mind conceives the state
house it isn&#8217;t pictured to me as standing there on
the hill, stately in the sunshine, but as it appeared
that night as I walked over from the Leland, with
the clouds flying low over its dome. The lower
floors were dark and still as sepulchres, and the messenger
boys who came over from the Western
Union, now and then, reminded me of ghosts as they
went by, their heels dragging on the marble floors
of the corridor. A light was burning in the governor&#8217;s
office, though the old man himself, I knew,
was over at the mansion, pacing the floor of the library
and cursing with classic curses. We were going
to try that night to pass the Bailey bill over his
veto.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the third floor blazed with electric lights, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the big dome was full of noisy echoes. The senate
kept its coat on&mdash;you know how they mimic decorum
over there&mdash;but the house was in its shirt-sleeves,
huddled like a pack of wolves around the
speaker&#8217;s dais, with faces ripe with whisky, shaking
its fists under the umbrella of cigar smoke. Every
fellow was trying to get his bill passed in the last
hour of the session&mdash;you know what it is, Hank?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oah, yes,&#8221; replied Jennings, &#8220;but &#8217;tain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;
to what &#8217;t used to be under the ol&#8217; constitution. We&#8217;d
stack a pile o&#8217; them &#8217;ere private acts up on the clerk&#8217;s
desk, an&#8217; pass &#8217;em all t&#8217; oncet &#8217;ith a whoop. Them
&#8217;as the days&mdash;but that &#8217;as &#8217;fore your time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those must have been good old days,&#8221; assented
the lobbyist, &#8220;for the gang.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon! A feller could &#8217;a&#8217; done business in
them days! Ol&#8217; John M.&#8217;d better left the ol&#8217; constitution
alone&mdash;it &#8217;as good enough. But there &#8217;as a
passion fer change right after the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lobbyist politely nodded concurrence in this
view and continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the members clambered on to their
desks, filling the air with oaths, ink bottles, and hurtling
books with rattling leaves. Sometimes an iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
weight sheathed in paper whizzed by on a vindictive
mission, and one man made an Egyptian nigger-killer
with rubber bands. Some even hurled their
copies of the revised statutes&mdash;it was the first use
they had ever found for them. Once in a while some
one would toss a batch of printed bills to the ceiling,
where they set the glass prisms of the chandeliers
jingling, and then fell like autumn leaves, a shower
of dead pledges and withered hopes. And out of all
the hubbub rose a steady roar&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like at a lynchin&#8217; bee,&#8221; assisted Jennings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; assented Baldwin, who had never seen
a lynching. &#8220;There were drunken howls and vacuous
laughs, and yet we could hear through it all the
hoarse voice of the clerk, his throat so heated that
you could see the vapor of his breath, as you can an
orator&#8217;s, or a wood-chopper&#8217;s in winter, rapidly intoning
senate bills on third reading. The pages were
growing heedless and impertinent. The newspaper
correspondents, their despatches on the wires, puffed
their cigarettes in professional unconcern, and
awaited happenings worthy of late bulletins. The
older members, who had been through the mill many
times before, lounged low in their seats. One could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
see, above their desks, only their heads and heels.
The speaker, old &#8217;Zeke himself, was in the chair,
suave as ever, but growing caustic. He had splintered
his sounding-board early in the evening, and
had taken to tapping perfunctorily his walnut desk
with his little inadequate gavel. And yet he and the
older members and the newspaper men would cast
occasionally an anxious glance at the clock, and an
expectant one at the big doors.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I sat there on the old, red lounge under the
speaker&#8217;s flag-draped canopy, I noticed Henderson
of Greene, standing away back under the galleries
on the Democratic side, eying the proceedings with
the same mysterious stare that had never left him
since he had been sworn in. As I have said, I had
never spoken to the fellow, but I had always felt a
pity for him&mdash;he impressed me as a man who had
been stunned by repeated raps of bad luck. Along
toward the end of the session he had brought his
wife up from Greene County to the capital. She
had that tired look that country women have. Her
face was seamed, her cheeks hollow; her back was
bent in a bow, and she walked hurriedly, anxiously
along in her flapping skirts beside her tall and somber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
husband. She had never been away from home
before, and the boys had many a laugh over her
wonder at the trolley-cars purring along under the
maple trees, and her fear of the elevators in the
state house&mdash;though, for my part, I could see nothing
ludicrous in it all. She stayed three or four days
and they went everywhere, out to Oak Ridge to
see Lincoln&#8217;s tomb, over to Eighth Street to visit
his old homestead, up to the Geological Museum
where the moth-eaten stuffed animals are, and out
to Camp Lincoln. They took many trolley rides, and
even climbed to the top of the state house dome,
whence, they say, you can see Rochester and the
prairies for thirty miles around. He brought her
over to the house one or two mornings, but not on to
the floor as other members did their over-dressed
wives; he sent her up to the gallery, where she sat
peering down over the railing at the gang&mdash;and her
husband, who took no part in all that was going on.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old woman&#8217;s interest in all these new things
that had come into her starved life, her ill-concealed
pride in her husband&#8217;s membership in such a distinguished
body of law-givers, were touching to me,
and as I looked at him that last night of the session,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and thought of her, the wish to do something to
lighten their lives came into my heart, but just then,
suddenly, old &#8217;Zeke started from his chair, grasped
his gavel firmly, and leaned expectantly over his
desk. At the same instant the older members
dragged their feet down from their desks and sat
bolt upright. The newspaper men flung away their
cigarettes and adjusted their eye-glasses. The assistant
clerk, who had been reading, looked up from the
bill then under what I suppose they would have
called consideration, and hurriedly gave his place at
the reading-desk to the clerk of the house. I knew
what was coming. I knew that the Bailey bill was
on its way over from the senate. And I heard Bill
Hill call:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mistah Speakah.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the sound of that voice the uproar in the
chamber ceased. It became so still that the silence
tingled like a numbness through the body; stiller
than it had been any time since nine o&#8217;clock that
morning, when they had paused for the chaplain to
say his prayer. The gang turned around and stood
motionless, panting, in its shirt-sleeves, as though a
flashlight photograph were to be taken. Half-way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
down the aisle stood Hill. You know how he would
look at such a time, in his long black coat, his wide
white shirt bosom with the big diamond, his rolling
collar and black string tie, and his long black hair
falling to his shoulders. You know how he would
love such a moment&mdash;and it was his last chance that
session. He stood there quietly a whole minute, and
then putting a foot forward, said in his great bass
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mistah Speakah.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old &#8217;Zeke rose and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mister Doorkeeper.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A message from the senate, by its secretary.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A message from the senate by its secretary,&#8217;
repeated &#8217;Zeke, and then Bill had to give way to
Sam Pollard, who stepped forth and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Speaker, I am directed to inform the house
that the senate has passed senate bill No. 106&#8217;&mdash;I
never shall forget the number of that bill, after all
the sleepless nights it caused me, and the anxious
mornings scanning the calendar to see if its black
figures were there&mdash;&#8216;Senate bill No. 106. A bill
for an act to amend an act entitled: An Act concerning
the exercise of the right of eminent domain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
notwithstanding the objections of the governor&#8217;&mdash;you
know the lingo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, as the speaker said, &#8216;The clerk will read
the message,&#8217; Hen Harvey, who was clerk of the
house, stretched his arm over the narrow desk and
took the file from the page. The old man was mad
when he wrote that veto message, and he gave both
houses the devil. I never knew the legislature to get
such an unmerciful lamming in my life; it was outrageous,
for it was a good bill, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ought ter pass,&#8221; interjected Jennings, repeating
the trite phrase sententiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;But nobody heard it, for when Hen began to
read, the gang took a deep breath and began to
howl. From both sides of the chamber broke forth
a clamor of &#8216;Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker,&#8217; until in the
din even these words were lost, and there was just
that long, heavy roar. The boys came over from the
senate, for they had done their duty and had done
it nobly, in the face of a great storm of criticism,
combined with the abuse of the Chicago papers, and
they wanted to help lift in the house. And with
them came the crowd of reformers from the Municipal
League, and stood about with George Herrick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the old man&#8217;s private secretary. The reformers, as
George pointed out members here and there, and
whispered in their ears, supposed that they were
doing great things in the fight against the bill, but
that was only another time when they deluded their
precious selves. They did their reforming chiefly
at banquets, but George and the old man knew a
thing or two about politics themselves, and George,
standing back by the Democratic cloak-room, smoking
his little cigarettes, was directing that fight with
the party lash in his hand, and some of the best men
on the floor of the house to do his bidding. He was
the only private secretary I ever knew who could set
an army in the field.</p>

<p>&#8220;But through it all old &#8217;Zeke stood there, game as
ever, with a hard, cold smile on his face, and you
could hear the sharp, monotonous rap of his gavel,
rap, rap, rap, neither fast nor slow. The tumult
did not die during the reading of that scathing message,
and when Hen&#8217;s ruined voice ceased, and he
rolled the message up again and thrust it in his desk,
&#8217;Zeke smashed his gavel down and I heard him say:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Will the house be in order?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it was in order, for &#8217;Zeke knew how to compel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
order in that bear-pit when he wanted to, and he
never raised his voice to do it either, only his eye,
and the gavel. And so, when they were quiet, he
said: &#8216;The question is: Shall the house concur with
the senate in the passage of senate bill No. 106, notwithstanding
the objections of the governor?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The house tried to break away from him again,
but he held it in his gavel fist, drawing the curb
tight, and turned to recognize old Long John Riley,
who was standing like a tall tree beside his desk,
with his hand upraised.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The gentleman from Cook!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Speaker,&#8217; said Riley, &#8216;I move the previous
question.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was another roar, but &#8217;Zeke&#8217;s gavel fell,
and his eyes blazed black again, and he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The gentleman from Cook moves the previous
question, and the question is: Shall the main question
be now put? Those in favor of this question
will say aye&#8217;&mdash;there was a roar of ayes&mdash;&#8216;and those
opposed will say no.&#8217; There was a heavier roar of
noes, and then came the old cry: &#8216;Ayes and noes,
ayes and noes, Mr. Speaker, ayes and noes, damn
you, don&#8217;t you dare to shut off debate!&#8217; But &#8217;Zeke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
only smiled and his gavel cracked&mdash;and they were
still. Then in the stillness he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Gentlemen are as familiar with the rules as is
the chair. They are well aware that the chair is
powerless to order a roll-call after a <i>viva voce</i> vote,
unless he is in doubt as to the result, the demand for
the yeas and nays not having been preferred before
the question had been put to the house. In this
instance&#8217;&mdash;and the splendid old fellow swung his
gavel to his ear, and the smile flickered out of his
face&mdash;&#8216;in this instance the chair is not in doubt. The
ayes seem to have it, the ayes have it, and the main
question is ordered.&#8217; The hammer fell like a bolt,
and then calmly leaning on it, his eye traveled
around over the turbulent mob, until it lit on George
Herrick and his little band of dazed reformers&mdash;and
I knew he was thinking of the old man over in the
mansion whom he hated with an Indian&#8217;s hate&mdash;and
as he looked George in the eye, the cold smile
came back, and he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The question is: Shall the house concur with
the senate in the passage of senate bill No. 106,
notwithstanding the objections of the governor.
Upon this question those in favor of the bill will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
vote aye, and those opposed will vote no, when their
names are called, and the clerk will call the roll.&#8217;
The gavel fell, and the speaker, holding it where it
had fallen, leaned half his length over his desk and
motioned to Hen Harvey. Hen had taken off his
coat and vest and collar&mdash;he would call <i>that</i> roll
himself&mdash;and as he unbuttoned his cuffs, inclining
his head toward the speaker, &#8217;Zeke yelled in his ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now, Hen, damn it, call that roll to beat all
hell.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we knew that the Bailey bill fight was on
to a finish. We had had our first big battle with the
reformers, and were down together in the last ditch.
Whenever a bill with something in it is about to
pass the legislature, a strange quality steals into the
atmosphere, just as there does in the council chamber
in Chicago when anything is to be pulled off&mdash;don&#8217;t
you know? There is a forebodement, an
apprehensiveness, that electrifies the nerves and oppresses
the lungs. I felt it there that night. We
had had a heavy fight to pass the bill in the first
place, and now we had to override a veto! It&#8217;s
hard enough to get the seventy-seven votes that constitute
a majority, with the people against you&mdash;men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
are such cowards&mdash;but when it comes to rounding
up two-thirds&mdash;a hundred and two&mdash;it&#8217;s an entirely
different problem. We had been working
quietly at the thing for days, for we knew the veto
was coming, and that the old man would wait until
the last night to send it in. We had a hundred
and one tried and true men who would stick to the
end. The hundred and second was Jim Berry. We
had his promise, and believed he would stay in line&mdash;though
he was afraid of his constits&mdash;for he was
poor and in debt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judge Hardin came and sat beside me that we
might check them off for ourselves, and Hen began
calling the roll:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Allen!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aye!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ambaugh!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aye!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Anderson!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aye!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bartly!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aye!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The leaders, Jamison over on the Republican side,
and Riley on the Democratic, sat at their desks, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
roll-calls, at which they thoughtfully blew the smoke
of their cigars as they checked off the progress of the
vote. They appeared as unconcerned as the correspondents.
I never can forget the drollery of the
wink Jamison gave me as he voted no&mdash;it was necessary
to have some one who had voted with the
majority to move a reconsideration of the vote in
case anything happened. &#8217;Zeke did not resume his
seat during the roll-call, as the rules permitted him
to do, but stood bending over his desk with an alert
eye on the cadets. The vote up to this point was
propitious, but &#8217;Zeke knew, and Jamison and Riley
knew, and Judge Hardin and I knew, and we were
not so sanguine as the correspondents, who had
already begun to toss sheets of copy to the frowsy
telegraph boys, running to and fro between the press
gallery and the Western Union. We were chiefly
interested just then whether Berry would vote right
or not. I was keeping an eye on him and noticed
that he was beginning to fidget in his seat, and chew
his cigar, and tear paper into little pieces. And the
roll-call went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Beel!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aye!&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Bell!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bell, of course, was on the other side, and was
standing back with George Herrick, keeping their
fellows in line and cheering up the reformers from
the Municipal League, but we knew his vote would
have its effect on Berry, so I pulled the speaker&#8217;s
coat-tail, and &#8217;Zeke leaned over and whispered
hoarsely to the clerk. Hen observed a lengthened
pause and then began to call more slowly. Berry
was the next name.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Berry!&#8217; Hen drawled.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Berry!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hen looked long at Berry, and the poltroon sat
there with his eyes cast down, rolling his cigar
around and around in his mouth, tearing up his little
flakes of paper, and swinging from side to side in
his chair. Then Hen called the next name:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Briggs!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No!&#8217; he voted, and Berry looked up for the
first time since the bill had come over from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
senate. &#8217;Zeke rapped fiercely with his gavel, and Hen
paused. Then &#8217;Zeke said sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The chair is compelled again to call the attention
of gentlemen to rule three, which prohibits
smoking in the hall of the house. The chair dislikes
to be compelled to repeat this admonition so frequently,
and trusts that gentlemen will observe the
injunction without additional suggestion. The clerk
will proceed with the calling of the roll.&#8217; And he
smashed the broken sounding-board again with his
gavel. We needed time. Some of the members
laughed, but that only gave &#8217;Zeke a chance to gain
more time by rapping for order. We feared the effect,
however, on discipline. Then he called Brisbane,
one of our fellows, and he didn&#8217;t vote. I grew uneasy,
and Judge Hardin was squirming there beside me
on the lounge. When I thought of Berry I grew
mad, and wondered if we could save the bill without
him. At that instant my eye happened to light upon
Henderson of Greene. He was standing under the
gallery just as he had been standing all evening.
He seemed not to have moved. He had his hands
clasped awkwardly behind him, and was chewing his
tobacco contemplatively. And here was my chance!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
I thought of the pathetic biography in the house
directory. I thought of his wife as I had seen the
poor old thing going around town with him the week
before. I thought of the way he had worked and
toiled for her and all those children, and how little
life held for him. If I could get him for the bill
in Berry&#8217;s place, the Chicago people, I knew, would
be liberal with him, and he could go back home
better off in a financial way than when he came.
And so I motioned to Burke, and when he came up
I told him to ask the gentleman from Greene to
meet me at once in the speaker&#8217;s room, and I retired
to await him. Presently, in his clumsy way, he
shuffled in. He came close up to me, and when I
had given the poor devil a cigar he bent over to hear
what I might have to say. I asked him how he
was going to vote on the bill, and he said he thought
he would vote against it, inasmuch as the governor
had said it was a bad piece of legislation. Well,
there was no time to discuss that phase of the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Look here, comrade,&#8217; I said, &#8216;this is a bill that
concerns Chicago alone&mdash;it does not affect and can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
not affect you or your constituents one way or the
other, can it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; he said; &#8216;reckon not.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;They don&#8217;t even know down in Greene County
that there is such a bill, do they?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Reckon not,&#8217; he said, &#8216;leastways I hain&#8217;t heerd
ary one say nothin&#8217; &#8217;bout it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Of course you haven&#8217;t,&#8217; I said, &#8216;and what&#8217;s
more, you never will. Now, see here,&#8217; I said, &#8216;I&#8217;ll
be quite frank with you, for I like you&#8217;&mdash;he cast a
strange, sidling glance at me, distrustful, like all
farmers&mdash;&#8216;for I like you,&#8217; I said, &#8216;and I want to do
something for you. The men who are promoting
this legislation have exactly enough votes to pass it
over the governor&#8217;s veto, and it&#8217;s going to pass. On
this ballot they will have just ninety-one votes&mdash;one
of their men will vote against it to move a reconsideration
if necessary, and about ten will not vote.
When the absentees are called, these ten will vote
for the bill, and on the verification, you&#8217;ll see others
tumbling into the band-wagon. Now, your vote is
not needed, as you see, and, cast for the bill or
against it, can have no appreciable effect upon the
result. The bill will pass without your vote, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
you can not defeat it, for the hundred and two will
stand firm in the end. One of them, however&mdash;it
is Berry, I don&#8217;t mind telling you&mdash;is trying, at the
last minute, to force us into raising his price. You
can take his place, you can have his price of the easy
money with his raise added, if you will go out there
and vote for the bill.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He stood looking at the floor, ruminating.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I know, Henderson,&#8217; I continued, &#8216;that you are
a poor man, that you have a large family, that you
have to work hard for a living. You are going home
to-morrow, maybe not to come back here any more,
and you can go if you wish, with three thousand
dollars clean, cold cash in your pocket. What do
you say?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old man turned his face away and began to
fumble with his horny fingers at his chin. His hand
trembled as with a palsy. We could hear the roll-call
going on outside:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Donavin!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aye!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Donnelly!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aye!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Evans!&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;&#8216;No!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Finerty!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aye!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Fitzmeyer!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aye!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Flanigan!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aye!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hear them?&#8217; I said. &#8216;It&#8217;s nearly up to you&mdash;what
do you say?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old man&#8217;s lips quivered, and his calloused
fingers grated in his beard. He opened his lips to
speak, but his jaw moved helplessly. And we heard
Hen&#8217;s voice back there in the house calling&mdash;calling
so that you could have heard him over in the Leland
bar-room:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Geisbach!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;He is one of those who will change,&#8217; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Giger!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no response. &#8216;He&#8217;ll be all right when
they call the absentees,&#8217; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Gordon!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Griesheimer!&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Aye!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hear them?&#8217; I asked. The H&#8217;s came next, and
the old man, still fumbling with his chin, and without
turning his head began to talk:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Baldwin,&#8217; he said, &#8216;you&#8217;re right. I am a poor
man. I have a wife an&#8217; eight children. To-morrow
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back home, an&#8217; o&#8217; Monday I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
hunt a job&mdash;hunt a job in the harves&#8217; field. I&#8217;ve
worked hard all my life. I &#8217;spect to work hard all
my life. I&#8217;ll keep on huntin&#8217; jobs in the harves&#8217;
fields. I&#8217;ll probably die in the poor-house. I&#8217;ll be
buried in the potter&#8217;s field. God knows what&#8217;ll become
of that woman and them children.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He nodded his head as in assent to an indisputable
proposition, and his eyes widened as if in
fright. They were looking down the barren years
before him, and I felt in that moment glad of my
power to brighten them.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hallen!&#8217; we heard Hen call.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Henderson of Effingham.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aye!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old man straightened out his long, lank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
figure, and then suddenly he turned and looked me
in the eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But, Baldwin,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I come here last January
an honest man, and to-morrow I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back,
back to ol&#8217; Greene, back to my people, back to that
woman an&#8217; them children, an&#8217; Baldwin&#8217;&mdash;he gulped
the word&mdash;&#8216;Baldwin, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back an honest man.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Henderson of Greene!&#8217; Hen&#8217;s voice called, and
the old man stalked into the corridor and thundered
&#8216;No!&#8217; in a trumpet note.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lobbyist ceased. The train had stopped at
Chenoa, and they could hear the breathing of the
engine, breathing as a living thing when it rests.
The noise ceased presently, and the silence of the
wide country night ensued. They heard only the
notes that came from the throats of frogs, and the
stridulent drumming of the cicad&aelig;. Baldwin looked
at the two politicians, expecting some comment. The
oscitant Healy looked out of the window, into the
vast darkness brooding over the prairie town. Jennings
sat meditatively pulling at his moist mustache,
an expression of perplexity in his countenance, the
wrinkles of increasing concentration of mind gathering
in his brow. Presently, without a word, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
rose and left the compartment. When he returned
he was treading in his stockings, his coat and waistcoat
and collar had been removed, his suspenders
were hanging at his hips. He was evidently preparing
for his berth. Baldwin meanwhile had
pressed a button, and sent Gentry, the aged porter,
now in white jacket, for his bag, and laid out on the
seat beside him his pajamas, and a traveler&#8217;s case
filled with silver toilet articles. Jennings lifted his
own big valise to his knees, and from its depths drew
a bottle, wrapped heavily in a newspaper. He held
one of the heavy little glasses under the faucet of
the water-cooler, and allowed the water to trickle
into it. Then, peeling back the paper from his bottle,
he took a long pull from its naked neck, and
passed it to Baldwin. As he did so, his brows still
knotted in perplexity, he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d you say that feller&#8217;s name was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Henderson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Henderson of Greene, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jennings threw back his head and tilted the water,
deadly cold from the ice and tasting of smoke, into
his throat, and when he had rinsed his mouth, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
said, with the happy expression of a man who has
resolved a doubt:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oah, yes, John Henderson, of Greene. He lived
out at Rabb&#8217;s Corners. Yes, that&#8217;s him; the governor
&#8217;p&#8217;inted him public administrator of Greene
County right after that session.&#8221;</p>

<p>The train lurched, and Jennings, bracing himself,
wrapped up his bottle and stowed it carefully away
in his valise. And swinging the valise in one hand
and with the other hitching up his trousers, now
beginning to drag at his heels, he stepped away in
his stockinged feet to his berth.</p>

<p>Baldwin began to wind his watch, and the Limited,
with its three hundred tons, and its tossing heads
full of the schemes of politics, went careering away
on its paper wheels toward the capital of Illinois.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">SENATE BILL 578</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HE was a page in the Illinois legislature&mdash;&#8220;House
Page No. 7,&#8221; the bright metal badge
on the lapel of his little coat said&mdash;and all day long
he heard nothing but &#8220;Here, boy!&#8221; from city members,
or &#8220;Hey, bub!&#8221; from country members, or
&#8220;Hi, there, kid!&#8221; from the other pages, or &#8220;Get
a move on you, Seven!&#8221; as the chief page snapped
his fingers at him in his lordly way. His real name
was James, but he never heard that, now that his
father was dead. His mother called him Jamie.</p>

<p>Jamie was kept very busy and yet he enjoyed his
legislative duties. He felt that it was a big thing to
help, even in his humble little way, to make laws for
all the people in the state. It was pretty important,
for instance, to carry a paper from some member up
to the clerk&#8217;s desk, for after the clerk had read it,
on three different days, and the house had voted on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
it and passed it, and after it had been read on three
different days and passed by the senate, and after
the governor had read it and thought over it as
he walked back and forth between the executive
mansion and the state house, and had written his
name on it, it became a law, and everybody in the
state had to obey it or go to jail.</p>

<p>The people were called constituents, they seemed
to be divided up among all the members of the
legislature; everybody in the state house had his
constituents. Jamie felt that, as a legislator, he
should have some constituents, but he couldn&#8217;t decide
who his constituents were, and he didn&#8217;t like to ask
anybody. But finally he thought of his mother, and
when he told her that she was his constituent she
took his little face between her two hands and kissed
him and pressed her cheek to his. Her cheek was
moist with tears.</p>

<p>If everybody in the state house had been as good
to his constituents as Jamie, Illinois would have
been a very happy place in which to live. When his
father died, Jamie&#8217;s mother had to take in sewing
and to work hard to keep things going. She was
sad much of the time, and always looked tired,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
and this made Jamie sad. He longed to help her,
but he did not know what to do. Then a friend of
theirs, Mr. Woodbridge, said he could get Jamie a
place in the house as a page boy&mdash;they always say
&#8220;page boy&#8221; in the legislature&mdash;and one morning
Jamie&#8217;s mother dressed him in his Sunday suit and
sent him up to the state house with Mr. Woodbridge.</p>

<p>And so he became a page. He was paid a dollar
and a half a day. Every twenty days the payrolls
were made out, and Jamie would go down to
the treasury, sign his name in a big, round hand,
&#8220;James Horn,&#8221; and then proudly take home to his
mother thirty dollars in fresh, crisp, green bills!
His mother had wished him to stay in school, but,
of course, being a page was better than going to
school. There were no books to study, and then
you got out so much earlier every day! And more
than all, you couldn&#8217;t take home money from school!</p>

<p>The house met every morning at ten o&#8217;clock, and
after the speaker had taken his place under the canopy
where the beautiful flag was draped, and had
rapped for order, and the chaplain had prayed, the
clerk would call the roll for the introduction of bills.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
This was Jamie&#8217;s busiest time. Everybody would
have bills to introduce or petitions from his constituents
to present, and for an hour Jamie would be
scampering up and down the aisles between the
members&#8217; desks and the clerk&#8217;s desk. But after that
he had a breathing spell, and could sit on the speaker&#8217;s
steps and whisper to the speaker&#8217;s page, or look
about over the house and watch the members. There
were grave members from the country districts with
long whiskers and steel-bowed spectacles, there
were city members with fancy vests and diamonds,
there were Irish members and German members,
there was a Polish member named Kumaszynski,
and there was a negro member, who sat away back
on the Republican side almost under the galleries,
and was very quiet, and wore black clothes and gold
eye-glasses.</p>

<p>But there was one whom Jamie liked above all
the others. He was tall, with smiling blue eyes that
saw everything, and though his black hair was
patched with gray at the temples, his face was that
of a young man, clean-shaven and ruddy. He was
a Chicago member and the most fashionably dressed
man in the house&mdash;he wore a different suit of clothes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
every day. He was a lawyer and his name was
Bronson Meredith. Jamie loved him the first time
he ever saw him, and whenever Mr. Meredith
clapped his hands Jamie would spring to his side
before any other page had started, and if by chance
Mr. Meredith ever gave a resolution or a bill to any
of the other boys Jamie felt a twinge of jealousy
at his heart.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would loiter an instant beside Mr.
Meredith&#8217;s desk, and a smile from him made Jamie
happy all that day. Jamie longed to touch him with
his hand, but dared not. The only thing he could do
was to pat Mr. Meredith&#8217;s overcoat, with its soft,
silken lining, as it hung on its hook in the cloak-room.
At night, lying in his bed, Jamie would close
his eyes and see Mr. Meredith standing beside his
desk, his lips slightly parted in a smile, showing his
white teeth and replying so sharply to members who
interrupted him that they would shoot down into
their seats with red faces and all the other members
would laugh, while Mr. Meredith, raising his hand,
would go on with his speech, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Speaker, as I was about to remark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
when I yielded to the perplexing question of the
distinguished gentleman from Pike&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith was not often on his feet, as they
say in legislative bodies, but when he took part
in a debate all the other members kept still and
listened with their hands behind their ears, which
they didn&#8217;t do when any one else spoke. Mr. Meredith
was a leader&mdash;many called him a reformer.
Jamie decided that when he grew up he would be
a lawyer, a leader and a reformer.</p>

<p>Now, when the session was about over there was
a bill in the house which almost all the Chicago
members hoped to see made into a law; but Mr.
Meredith was against it. The country members,
too, for the most part, were against the bill, and
Jamie noticed that when it first came over from the
senate there was a stir in the house, and that every
time it came up, after that, all the members would
rush in from the cloak-rooms, or the lobbies, or the
supreme court library, or the rotunda of the state
house, to speak about it and to vote on it.</p>

<p>Jamie did not understand the bill, or know what
it was for; he only knew that it was something
about a franchise in Chicago, and that every week<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
a party of rich-looking gentlemen would come down
to Springfield and stand about in the house, or sit
on the big red lounge behind the speaker&#8217;s chair,
and whisper and try to get men to vote for it.</p>

<p>And Jamie knew, too, that it was called senate
bill No. 578; he impressed that number firmly on
his mind and could never forget it. He soon observed
that on any day when he saw S. B. 578 on
the calendar&mdash;which is a kind of program printed
every morning to tell what bills are coming up&mdash;Mr.
Meredith would be on his feet and make motions
and speeches, and that the gentlemen on the
speaker&#8217;s red lounge would scowl at him and the
other city members try to answer him. And Jamie
noticed that Mr. Meredith always succeeded in having
the bill referred back to some committee, or
did something to keep it from becoming a law.</p>

<p>Jamie read the newspapers now and then. He
always turned first to the base-ball news&mdash;the season
was just opening&mdash;and then to the legislative news,
although he never read that as carefully as he did
the base-ball news. Often he saw Mr. Meredith&#8217;s
name in the types&mdash;the papers said he was making
a gallant fight against the franchise grab. Jamie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
hoped with all his soul that Mr. Meredith would
win in that fight; not, of course, that he cared about
the franchise grab&mdash;he had, like many older persons,
very hazy ideas about that&mdash;but he always wished to
see Mr. Meredith win.</p>

<p>The spring had come, and as the legislature
usually ends early in June, and the work was piling
up, the house was meeting at nine o&#8217;clock in the
morning. The house adjourned every Friday at
noon, in order that the members might go home over
Sunday, and it didn&#8217;t meet again until Monday
afternoon at five o&#8217;clock, and then only for a few
minutes. The members who had gone home did not
get back until Tuesday morning, and there were
never many there Monday afternoon, not even a
quorum, and it was always understood that nothing
was to be done at that session. The chaplain prayed,
the journal of Friday&#8217;s session was read and approved,
and the house adjourned until Tuesday
morning.</p>

<p>But one Monday afternoon when Jamie reached
the hall of the house he was surprised to find a big
body of members there&mdash;almost all the Chicago
members except Mr. Meredith. Those rich gentlemen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
were there, too, sitting on the speaker&#8217;s red
lounge. Jamie looked for Mr. Meredith&mdash;he was
not there. He thought instantly of senate bill 578&mdash;something
was up! They were going to try to
pass senate bill 578&mdash;that was why the gentlemen
were there on the speaker&#8217;s red lounge; that was
why the Chicago members had come down to
Springfield on the Monday afternoon train instead
of waiting for the Monday night train. Jamie was
worried.</p>

<p>It was a balmy spring day with a sky blue and
tender, and a soft wind that wafted strange sweet
country smells about, smells that filled Jamie with
dreamy longings and a kind of pleasant sadness.
The speaker gently tapped with his gavel; the good
old chaplain rose and spread out his white hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Lord,&#8221; he prayed, &#8220;we thank Thee that the
winter is past, that the rain is over and gone, that
the flowers appear upon the earth, that the time of
the singing of birds is come.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words stole sweetly in upon Jamie&#8217;s soul. He
sat on the steps, looking out of the open windows
at the tender young leaves of the maple trees&mdash;it
was just the way he used to look out of the open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
windows in school before vacation came, when he
thought of the swimming-hole out at Sycamore and
of going barefooted. It was all so calm and peaceful.
But with the chaplain&#8217;s &#8220;Amen!&#8221; the speaker&#8217;s
gavel cracked and the buzzing noise peculiar to the
house began again. And Jamie awoke from his
reveries with a start. He had heavier things to
think of now; he was almost a man; he was in the
legislature. Senate bill 578 was on its third reading,
the gang was present, and Mr. Meredith had not
come. Jamie was troubled, and sighed. He must
attend to his duties&mdash;he must do something.</p>

<p>Jamie looked over all the faces before him; nowhere
could he find one man he could trust as a
friend of Mr. Meredith.</p>

<p>He glanced at the door with a lingering hope
that Mr. Meredith would appear, but of course he
did not come. Then Jamie slowly hitched down the
speaker&#8217;s stairs, a step at a time, and, reaching the
floor, slipped over by the reporters&#8217; boxes&mdash;empty
that afternoon, for the correspondents, like the legislators,
never returned until Tuesday morning&mdash;and
thence into the side aisle, under the gallery, and to
the cloak-room. There he got his cap, looked longingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
at Mr. Meredith&#8217;s hook, empty now, with no
satin-lined overcoat for him to nestle lovingly
against for a blissful second, and then he went out
into the hall under the huge dome. No one, of
course, observed a mere page boy, but Jamie felt, as
he clicked his hurrying little heels across the marble
floors, that something was about to poke him in
his cold, unprotected back&mdash;the fear of a rear attack
that boyhood inherits from its far-distant savage
ancestry. Jamie didn&#8217;t take the elevator, or the
grand staircase, but reached the main floor by leaping
two steps at a time down a narrow side stairway,
unused and dark.</p>

<p>Then he flew out of the east entrance, ran down
the wide walk and on up Capitol Avenue for four
long blocks&mdash;ran as fast as he could pump his little
short legs to the hotel where he knew Mr. Meredith
lived when he was at the capital. But Jamie had no
hope of finding him there that afternoon. He went to
the hotel simply because he did not know where else
to go&mdash;that was all. Rushing into the hotel and
up to the clerk&#8217;s desk, he put his chin over its edge
and, as the clerk leaned down with his face almost
in Jamie&#8217;s face, the boy panted:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>&#8220;Is&mdash;now&mdash;Honorable Bronson Meredith in?&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk smiled and Jamie blushed, fearing the
clerk was making fun of him. And his heart sank&mdash;he
might have known Mr. Meredith was not in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom did you say?&#8221; asked the clerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honorable Bronson Meredith&mdash;the gentleman
from Cook&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk was knitting his brows, though the
wrinkles about his lips were twitching as if he found
it hard to keep them from rippling out into smiles.
Jamie thought the clerk was wonderfully stupid not
to know such a great man as Mr. Meredith, and he
added, in order to jog the man&#8217;s memory a little:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know&mdash;the reformer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk straightened up, placed his hands on
his hips, threw back his head and laughed. Jamie
stared at him with wide eyes&mdash;he saw nothing to
laugh at, especially when senate bill 578 was coming
up. Presently the clerk took one of his hands from
his side and dropped it on the big bell beside the
register, and as it clanged out in the empty lobby,
he shouted in his laughing voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Front!&#8221;</p>

<p>A bell-boy in buttons slid to the desk just as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
page boy does in the house when a member claps
his hands. The bell-boy and Jamie looked each other
all over from head to toe in the instant they stood
there facing each other, and the clerk began:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go see if Mr. Meredith&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And just then a tall form appeared around the
corner of a wall, and Jamie looked up.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Meredith himself, as smiling as the
spring, with a bunch of violets in the lapel of his
new light coat. Jamie sprang at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Meredith,&#8221; he exclaimed, raising his
clasped hands almost appealingly, &#8220;come&mdash;quick!
Come quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; said Mr. Meredith,
halting in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got senate bill 578 up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith&#8217;s eyes opened; his face lost its mild
expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about senate bill 578?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jamie took him by the coat&mdash;he dared at last to
lay hands on his sacred person&mdash;and tugged as he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, honest&mdash;Mr. Meredith&mdash;honest&mdash;cross my
heart they have&mdash;you&#8217;ll be too late!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>Mr. Meredith looked at the pleading lad closely,
and then suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! You&#8217;re one of the page boys.&#8221; And
then he ran as fast as he could through the lobby,
down the steps and across the sidewalk, Jamie after
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; cried Mr. Meredith, as he stooped to
plunge into a carriage at the curb, dragging Jamie in
after him, and shouting to the driver:</p>

<p>&#8220;The state house&mdash;fast as you can drive!&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver whirled his carriage about in Sixth
Street, and as Mr. Meredith drew in his head and
slammed the heavy door he shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Faster there&mdash;I&#8217;ll double your fare!&#8221;</p>

<p>The carriage lurched around the corner, the lash
of the driver&#8217;s whip writhed in the air, and the
horses went galloping with the rattling old hack
down Capitol Avenue. And as the carriage pitched
and rocked Jamie was supremely happy&mdash;he had
done what he could, and, better than all, he was
sitting beside Mr. Meredith and actually riding in
the same hack with him!</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith was silent until the carriage whirled
into the state house grounds and the horses, breathing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
heavily, were plunging up the driveway toward
the north portico. Then he turned and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d they know I was in town?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jamie looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; replied Mr. Meredith, &#8220;whoever sent
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jamie felt hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;But no one sent me, Mr. Meredith,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I
just came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how did you know I was here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guessed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith was thoughtful for an instant and
then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;But why did you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jamie blushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;now&mdash;&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like
to tell.&#8221; And he hid his face against Mr. Meredith&#8217;s
sleeve.</p>

<p>The carriage stopped, the driver leaped from his
box and flung open the door. Mr. Meredith sprang
out, leaped up the stone steps, ran down the corridors,
dashed into the elevator and was shot up to
the third floor. Jamie had been compelled to run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
faster than he ever did in his life to keep up with
him. He was nearly pinched by the iron door of
the elevator as the man slid it shut.</p>

<p>But he was close at Mr. Meredith&#8217;s heels when
he ran into the house. The few senators, having
just concluded a perfunctory Monday afternoon session
over in their more or less solemn chamber,
were bustling into the hall of the house, evidently
expecting something of interest to occur. They
pressed by the doorkeeper, and as they entered
Jamie heard the speaker cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentleman from Cook asks unanimous consent
to have senate bill 578 taken up out of the
regular order, read at large a third time, and put
upon its passage. Are there any objections?&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker raised his gavel, waited an instant,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The chair hears&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But suddenly a voice beside Jamie rang out like
a bugle:</p>

<p>&#8220;Object!&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker looked up in amazement. The members
of the gang turned about in their seats with
startled, guilty faces; the rich gentlemen on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
speaker&#8217;s red lounge leaned forward with pained
expressions. Mr. Meredith was striding down the
center aisle, his hat in his hand, his face red, his eyes
on fire.</p>

<p>Half-way down the aisle he halted, and once more
shouted in that fearless note:</p>

<p>&#8220;I object! A million people in Chicago to-night
are waiting to hear from this house on this franchise
bill&mdash;I dare you to take it up in this star-chamber
session!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith&#8217;s hand swept a wide arc that included
the whole house as he flung his defiance, and
then he stood glaring at them all. The eyes that
met Mr. Meredith&#8217;s eyes quailed; the house was still.
No one rose, no one replied to him.</p>

<p>Then after a long minute of this painful silence
the speaker, lowering his head until Jamie could not
see his face, said in a low voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Objections are heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the franchise grab bill was not taken up
that day after all.</p>

<p>The session was very short after that, and when
the house adjourned Mr. Meredith went down to the
speaker&#8217;s dais. The speaker looked up as if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
thought Mr. Meredith was coming to speak to him,
but Mr. Meredith stopped at the steps, and taking
Jamie&#8217;s little hand he pressed it in his own big palm
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the proudest moment of Jamie&#8217;s life as he
walked out of the noisy chamber, through the crowd
of angry, baffled members, past the staring pages, by
the wondering doorkeepers, and so on out into the
rotunda. They walked down the great white staircase,
and as they were passing around the polished
brass railing of the balcony on the second floor
Mr. Meredith said, as if suddenly reminded of
something:</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg your pardon, but what&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;James Horn,&#8221; replied Jamie.</p>

<p>They kept on and Jamie wondered where they
were going, until they turned into the governor&#8217;s
offices. Jamie&#8217;s heart leaped suddenly. Surely this
was a day of big surprises, thought he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the governor in?&#8221; Mr. Meredith asked of the
governor&#8217;s private secretary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;just go right in, Mr. Meredith,&#8221; and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
another instant Jamie was standing beside Mr. Meredith
in the presence of the governor.</p>

<p>The governor rose as they entered, and looked
first at Mr. Meredith, then lowered his kind blue
eyes and fixed them on Jamie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Governor,&#8221; said Mr. Meredith, &#8220;I wish to present
my little friend, Master James Horn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor bowed, took Jamie&#8217;s hand in his
own and said in his soft voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad to meet you, Master Horn, I&#8217;m
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jamie felt himself tingle all through at the governor&#8217;s
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Horn, Governor,&#8221; continued Mr. Meredith,
&#8220;is a page boy in the house, and to-day, when
we were all caught napping, he saved the franchise
bill from becoming a law.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor, looking a question at Mr. Meredith,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Mr. Meredith, and then, when
the governor had motioned them to take seats, and
Jamie had worked and wiggled himself away back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
into a deep leather chair, with his legs and feet sticking
straight out in front of him, Mr. Meredith told
the governor the whole story. When he had done, the
governor rose and went over to where Jamie sat
in the big chair, his arms stretched along the chair&#8217;s
arms.</p>

<p>Jamie would have wriggled out of the chair, but
he had not time to do so. And then, as he looked up
into the grave, kind face, His Excellency, speaking
very seriously, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy, you have done the people of Chicago
and the people of Illinois a great service&mdash;a service
you will understand some day&mdash;and now, on their
behalf, I wish to thank you for it.&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">MACOCHEE&#8217;S
FIRST CAMPAIGN FUND</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SQUIRE GODDARD had been renominated as
mayor of Macochee for the fifth time, and for
three weeks had played his customary checker
games with the firemen in the town hall, serene in
the conviction that he could not fail of re&euml;lection.
Then suddenly he awakened to the fact that he had
been the victim of a gum-shoe campaign. Election
was but a week off, and something had to be done.
So they raised a campaign fund. Now, Macochee,
in that day, had never had a campaign fund.
The state committee never put any money into
Gordon County, even in a presidential year. The
Republicans didn&#8217;t have to, and the Democrats
knew better. The local candidates, of course, had
little expenses of their own&mdash;for cigars, for carriages
when there were township meetings out in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the little red school-house, for printing the tickets
(in the days before we had the Australian ballot),
and for Ganson&#8217;s hack to use at the polls on election
day, but they were stingy in these things. Macochee
and Gordon County always went right, anyhow.
Joe Boyle, Captain Bishop, Major Turner,
old Bill Williams and John Ernest had been parceling
the fat offices in the court-house among
themselves ever since the war, and all a county convention
ever had to do was to renominate the old
ticket, and it went through in November without a
scratch. Sometimes, because of curious constitutional
prejudices against a county treasurer succeeding
himself, they had to run Captain Bishop
for county clerk, and let old Bill Williams have the
treasury, but it only meant, after all, changing the
combination a little, and beyond the trouble of moving
some favorite old desk chairs, which had
molded themselves to rheumatic backs, from one
side of the court-house to the other, the ring remained
undisturbed in that ancient, life-giving pile.
Of course they had to find a new candidate for
prosecuting attorney every six years, but, fortunately,
the crop of young lawyers is one that never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
fails, whatever party is in power down in Washington.</p>

<p>And so, among a virgin electorate, the advent of
a campaign fund was an impressive event. The
people felt that they had entered upon a new era in
their political life, just as they did when the council
bought the new fire apparatus and began to agitate
the question of bonding the town for water-works&mdash;a
proposition, by the way, upon which the leading
citizens sat down quickly enough, because it meant
taxes&mdash;while the line of loafers leaning against the
court-house fence increased, waiting for the distribution.
They had vague notions about a campaign
fund in Macochee. The amount was reputed
to be five hundred dollars, and, technically, it was in
the custody of the court-house ring, but as they had
never had a campaign fund to disburse before, and
could not decide how to proceed, it was temporarily
locked in the county treasurer&#8217;s vault, where, not being
interest on the public moneys, it was comparatively
safe. Meanwhile they were sticking closer than
brothers. They would not allow one of their number
out of their sight. They went to their meals in
relays, and held night sessions in the treasury, losing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
sleep and rest, so that all their latent diseases,
rheumatics, phthisis, lumbago, gravel, and so on,
were aggravated. They became cross, jealous and
suspicious, full of envy, debate, deceit, malignity;
whisperers, back-biters, despiteful, proud, boasters,
inventors of evil things. They swore as they had
not sworn since the battle of Port Republic. They
cursed each other, they cursed Horace Goddard,
and when these subjects failed, they cursed young
Halliday.</p>

<p>Young Halliday was at the bottom of all the
deviltry in Macochee. He had not been out of
Harvard a month before all the good people in the
town were wagging their heads sadly and saying:
&#8220;Tsck! Tsck! Tsck!&#8221; He parted his hair in the
middle. He brought home a habit of dropping his
r&#8217;s, and of pronouncing his a&#8217;s with a broad accent,
as, for instance, when he said &#8220;rawther;&#8221; he
smoked cigarettes, puffed a heavy brier pipe, wore
red neckties and knickerbockers, and he drank beer.
And he did something else, something that struck
the moral fiber of the town on the raw. He changed
his politics and became a Democrat!</p>

<p>Being a Democrat in Macochee is like being a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Republican in Alabama. There are hardly enough
Democrats in Macochee&mdash;outside of the fifth ward,
which is Irish&mdash;to hold primaries, and they always
have mass conventions to hide their political nakedness.
Hank Defrees, the only Democratic lawyer in
Macochee, insisted that conventions were necessary
in order to keep up the party organization. He liked
to go over to Columbus every two years as delegate
to the state convention. It afforded him an outing
and a chance at the whisky in the Neil House.
Besides, it is something to go to the state convention
with the solid vote of any county, even Gordon, in
your vest pocket. The local Democrats humored
Hank. He had been their only available timber
for Common Pleas judge and prosecuting attorney,
and he had been sacrificed on the altar of his party
times enough, surely, to entitle him to whatever
there was in sight.</p>

<p>But George Halliday had been reared a Republican.
His father had been an Abolitionist, the
friend of Salmon P. Chase, and his home had been
known in its time as one of the stations of the underground
railway. He had voted for John C. Fremont,
and he had voted a straight Republican ticket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
ever since. George had responded to these home
influences sympathetically, and had given early
promise of that vital interest in politics for which
Ohio mothers ardently look in their sons. His first
experience in politics was in 1876, when he took an
active part in the Hayes-Tilden campaign, crying
after the little Catholic boys from the parochial
school, on his homeward way at evening:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Fried rats and pickled cats,</div>
<div class="verse">Are good enough for Democrats.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And once he marched with a party of his playmates
in a torchlight procession, under a transparency
which announced exultantly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Hurrah for Hayes! He&#8217;s the man!</div>
<div class="verse">If we can&#8217;t vote, our daddies can!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>That was a fine campaign, extending far beyond
autumn, and during the long winter evenings he had
been allowed to sit up, sometimes until after nine
o&#8217;clock, to hear his father read in the Cincinnati
<i>Gazette</i>, of the bloody deeds of the Ku-Klux Klan.
The strange, cabalistic words froze the very blood
in his veins. At night he would hear the drumming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
of horses&#8217; hoofs, and see white-sheeted forms galloping
by in the gloom. Sometimes they halted and
looked at him through big black eyeholes.</p>

<p>These were the Ku-Klux, and he was afraid, until
the evening his father came home radiant, sat down
to the supper table with a smile that gave a fine cheer
to the room and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we got Hayes in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later, when he was in the high school, he became
a member of the Blaine and Logan marching club,
wore a red oilcloth cape and carried a torch. As he
trudged along Macochee&#8217;s streets, strangely unfamiliar
in the darkness, breathing the smoke of the
flaring torches, intoxicated by the tired throbbing of
the bass drum, he would shout in unison with the
hoarse voices of excited men:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Blaine&mdash;Blaine,</div>
<div class="verse">James&mdash;G.&mdash;Blaine!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then the procession, debouching into the Square,
was swallowed up by the crowd; nothing remained
of it but extinguished reeking torches scattered here
and there among the thousands of restless heads.
George wriggled his way up to the festooned band<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
stand, he saw the pale speakers and the countless
vice-presidents&mdash;his father was one of the vice-presidents&mdash;and
he listened to the inspiring song of
the Glee Club:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Dinna ye hear the slogan,</div>
<div class="verse">Jimmy Blaine and Johnny Logan?</div>
<div class="verse">The plumed knight and warrior bold</div>
<div class="indent">Are bound to gain the day.</div>
<div class="verse">The golden gates are creaking</div>
<div class="verse">While the Yankee boys are speaking,</div>

</div></div>

<p>His eyes had been blurred by the tears, his heart
had ached with the secret pain of patriotism. He
had registered sweet vows; he never could forget&mdash;and
yet, now, just as his education was complete
and he was ready to enter upon his career, just as
the new sign of the new firm of Halliday and Halliday,
attorneys-at-law, was swinging at the foot of
the stairs in the People&#8217;s National Bank block, he
had turned Democrat. It was a sore subject at
home. He and his father no longer discussed the
tariff question. Mrs. Halliday said it made her
nervous, as it might anybody.</p>

<p>That winter Halliday did nothing more serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
than to attend a Catholic fair in Father Hennessey&#8217;s
church, and make a speech awarding the prize some
one had won in the raffle. But in the spring, Hank
Defrees, loafing around among the boys, told them
the thing to do was to nominate George for mayor
on the Democratic ticket, and it was done. When
old Horace Goddard heard of the nomination, he
chuckled until his great belly shook, and actually
invited Captain Bishop and the rest of the boys, who
had gathered at the post-office to wait for the seven
o&#8217;clock mail, around to Cramer&#8217;s drug store to have
a drink. The cronies all laughed as they drank&mdash;though
they said, with soberness, that they felt sorry
for old Judge Halliday himself.</p>

<p>It was a cruel thing to do, and it was young Halliday&#8217;s
idea alone. He was a youth with aspirations,
and he saw in the nomination something more than
the mere compliment Hank Defrees had intended.
Therefore Squire Goddard&#8217;s checker game was interrupted
by a black-coated delegation of Protestant
clergymen. It was a Monday morning, and they
must have come straight from preachers&#8217; meeting
with their impudent questions. They wanted to
know whether or not it was true that the liquor laws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
had not been enforced, and how he stood on the
saloon question generally. The old squire puffed
profusely and made promises. The next day a
committee of saloon-keepers was called. The old
man blew out his varicose cheeks and sputtered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve ran for mayor o&#8217; this &#8217;ere town now goin&#8217; on
five times, and I&#8217;m dog <i>damned</i> if I ever heerd such
a lot o&#8217; fool questions before!&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day it was rumored that Father Hennessey
had told his parishioners that Squire Goddard
could not be trusted. Then the storm broke.
The W. C. T. U. held a mass meeting and issued an
appeal to save the boys. That night husbands were
put on the rack of domestic inquisition. They had
it pointed out to them that there was a drunkard in
every fifth family&mdash;statistics proved it&mdash;and parents
didn&#8217;t want their boys exposed any longer to such
temptations. No one knew where the statistical
lightning was going to strike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you want to intrust the regulation of
the rum power to the Democrats, do you?&#8221; sneered
the husbands, with ironical grunts, thereby moving
the previous question and closing the debate. Nevertheless,
after that the mayor was kept busy explaining,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
which is the direst necessity that can befall a
candidate. He encountered Halliday in the Square
one day, and blazed forth:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re gittin&#8217; too smart &#8217;round this town all to
onct, young feller. You know more&#8217;n your pap
a&#8217;ready, an&#8217; if he can&#8217;t l&#8217;arn ye no respec&#8217; fer yer
elders, I will.&#8221; He shook a palsied fist at the youth,
as he added, in a tone almost pitiable: &#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ll
tell him jest what you done, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Defeat might have killed the old man, and the
campaign was beginning to tell on him. But when
they raised the fund, it was as a hot and sweetened
toddy to warm the cockles of his heart. While he
had no adequate concept of it, and while the manner
of its working was a mystery to him, he did not
doubt its efficacy. He felt safe. Also, as the subject
of the only campaign fund Gordon County
had ever known, he felt a supreme importance,
which swelled out his chest and filled him with a ripe
content. He even found himself taking the opposition
with some zest, now that it was certain to be
non-effective. Three days more, thought the squire,
and it would be all over. He imagined some sort of
civic triumph for himself. He dreamed of a serenade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
by the Macochee Silver Cornet Band, in the
evening, under the shade of the pine trees about his
home. He dramatized himself as bowing and smiling
on the front porch. He would go out just as
he was, in his shirt-sleeves and slippers, his silver-bowed
spectacles on his nose, and the Cincinnati
paper in his hand. It would be thus more spontaneous,
more democratic. Mandy would stand
behind him, holding the lamp high. The front picket
fence would be black with people. He wondered if
there would be enough of the campaign fund left to
provide the cake she must offer the band boys, and
whether a part of its office was to meet such contingencies.
So the old squire sat in his old chair,
the split bottom of which had been worn shiny years
ago, and smoked his old pipe, with sharp, dry puffs
of contentment.</p>

<p>The squire looked forward to disbursing the fund
himself, but the court-house ring still clung to it in
indecision. Friday morning, when they met, election
was but three days off, and the ring agreed that
they must get down to business. Major Turner
said, with profound wisdom, that money could be
used to best advantage in the saloons. Charley Bassett&mdash;he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
was prosecuting attorney then&mdash;asked,
with a lawyer&#8217;s passion for fine distinctions, in what
sense the major employed the word &#8220;used.&#8221; Before
the major could reply&mdash;he had knit his brows and
was whittling a fresh chew from his plug, to irrigate
his thought&mdash;old Bill Williams said:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that won&#8217;t do; we must use it to get out the
vote.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bassett, who always annoyed the
old fellows with his young haggling, &#8220;how&#8217;ll you
get out the vote?&#8221;</p>

<p>The auditor, with an effort at something definite,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we must have organization&mdash;that&#8217;s what
wins in elections these days.&#8221; He shook his head, in
a keen triumph, for the phrase pleased him, as
phrases do please politicians. He began to conceive
himself&mdash;gladly, as a great political leader, as an
organizer of victory. &#8220;Organization, that&#8217;s the
word,&#8221; he persisted, and then, growing bolder, he
brought his fist down on his fat knee, and plunged
on heedlessly into detail.</p>

<p>&#8220;You just give me that fund,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll
show you,&#8221; he brought up lamely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>&#8220;Well, tell us how you&#8217;d spend it,&#8221; insisted Bassett.
&#8220;What&#8217;d you buy first? Remember, election&#8217;s
only next Tuesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, why,&#8221; hesitated Williams, &#8220;I&#8217;d spend it
gittin&#8217; out the vote. I&#8217;d git kerriages, and have
signs painted to hang on the horses, readin&#8217;,&#8221; and he
lined the imaginary letters on the rough palm of his
left hand with the gnarled forefinger of his right,
&#8220;&#8216;Republican City Committee&mdash;Vote for Goddard.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The old squire, tickled with the sound of the last
legend, broke in with:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the idee, Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course,&#8221; said Williams, expanding more and
more, &#8220;I seen &#8217;em that way when I was in Columbus
onct, on &#8217;lection day. Get about five good two-horse
kerriages&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the captious Bassett, remembering that old
Bill&#8217;s son-in-law, Hi Wellman, kept the livery stable,
interrupted him by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that wouldn&#8217;t cost more&#8217;n twenty dollars,
and, anyway, we can use our own buggies, same as
we&#8217;ve always done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Bishop, who had been carefully combing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
his whiskers with his fingers, then advanced his
scheme.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that we&#8217;d ought to have
a campaign committee, with a treasur&#8217; and a finance
committee, and let the treasur&#8217; pay out only on warrants
drawed by the finance committee&mdash;then
there&#8217;d be no question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there&#8217;d be no question,&#8221; said Bassett cynically,
&#8220;there&#8217;d be no question. And the finance
committee could draw warrants for their own arrest,
while they&#8217;re about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ring gasped, and though the captain tried to
say something about business methods, they were all
silent for a long time, chewing their tobacco gravely
and thoughtfully, until the squire nervously ventured
to ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;But what do you think we&#8217;d best spend it fer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Votes,&#8221; said Bassett laconically.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s surely what we want,&#8221; said Judge Ernest,
speaking for the first time. The old men in the
circle wheeled toward the probate judge. They had
not been surprised at what Bassett said, for he never
attended service, and was reputed to be a free-thinker,
but Judge Ernest was a pillar in the church.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>&#8220;Why, John,&#8221; said Major Turner, &#8220;you don&#8217;t
mean to say you&#8217;d buy votes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t say I would, did I?&#8221; snapped the old man,
wriggling uneasily in his Delaware chair. &#8220;I meant
that the money ought to be used so as to produce
votes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; assented Bassett.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if it don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; the judge went on,
&#8220;why we&#8217;d ought to give it back to them as contributed.&#8221;
The judge offered this solution with a new
hope dawning in his heart, for he had mourned over
the ten dollars he had invested in the fund. A murmur
of approval ran around the ring, and the old
squire, fearing the dissolution of the fund, was the
only one in the room whose face did not glow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, boys,&#8221; said Joe Bogle, &#8220;we might
whack her up among the crowd and everybody do
the best they can with their share.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I call a grand su&#8217;gestion,&#8221; said
Judge Ernest, shaking his head approvingly.</p>

<p>But Bassett shook his head the other way. &#8220;No,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;that won&#8217;t do, we want some system in this
thing. It ought to be changed into dollar bills and
then given to the central committeemen to use in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
their wards election day. Of course we won&#8217;t need
so much in the strong Republican wards&mdash;we&#8217;ll put
it out in Lighttown and down in Gooseville among
the niggers, and some of it across the tracks among
the boys in the shops&mdash;that&#8217;s where it&#8217;ll tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the ring stubbornly opposed the idea of
letting that pile of money go out of its hands. They
put only young men on the city committee, and the
honor and importance were enough for them. They
would be wanting office next.</p>

<p>The old squire voiced the protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pears to me,&#8221; he whined, &#8220;that as I&#8217;m runnin&#8217;,
I&#8217;d ought to have a leetle of it fer my own expenses
on &#8217;lection day. I&#8217;ve been givin&#8217; of my services to
the party now fer nigh on to twenty year, not
countin&#8217; my term in the army, and it&#8217;s expensive,
&#8217;specially with that young Halliday carryin&#8217; on the
way he is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one never made up a fund for none of us,
Hod Goddard,&#8221; chorused the old fellows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and there&#8217;s others on the ticket besides
you,&#8221; interrupted Bassett. &#8220;Let each candidate
spend his own money if he wants to. You hain&#8217;t
paid your assessment yet, anyhow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>&#8220;But I&#8217;m the head o&#8217; the ticket,&#8221; stammered the
squire, his red face deepening to purple.</p>

<p>The booming of the town clock in the court-house
tower startled the ring, and the county officials
glanced at their big silver watches. They were already
half an hour late for their dinners.</p>

<p>&#8220;And my wife told me to fetch home some meat,&#8221;
said Bassett, forgetting all else as he seized his hat.</p>

<p>And so the conference broke up. Saturday night
came, they had no solution, and, like those that do
business in great waters, were at their wits&#8217; end.</p>

<p>Sunday morning a report spread through the
town that caused the ring to take heart of grace. It
was a report of serious defections in Halliday&#8217;s
ranks. Jerry Sullivan, Scotty Gordon, old man
Garwood, Rice Murrell and even Hank Defrees had
been going about town all Saturday afternoon and
evening, and everywhere they went they told people
it was no use&mdash;Halliday couldn&#8217;t be elected. He
might have been two weeks ago, if he had acted differently,
but now&mdash;they shook their heads. They
couldn&#8217;t stand for him any more&mdash;he needn&#8217;t look
to them for support&mdash;he hadn&#8217;t treated them right&mdash;they
had been fools to expect anything from such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
a dude. Five hundred dollars, they said, judiciously
used, would settle his hash. They wished they had
the management of it, they would revenge themselves
for his slights and insults. And these were
representative men, even if their portraits had not
been made in half-tone for the <i>History of Gordon
County</i>.</p>

<p>Jerry Sullivan lived on the hill behind the
priest&#8217;s house, and was the &#8220;darlint&#8221; of all the old
women in Lighttown. He was a lad of power in the
Fifth Ward. Scotty Gordon lived across the tracks
in the Second Ward and worked in the shops. Old
man Garwood lived just at the edge of town, on the
Blue Jacket road, in the Fourth Ward, and Rice
Murrell, the Reverend Rice Murrell, the pastor of
the A. M. E. church&mdash;who had turned Democrat
when they took the janitorship of the court-house
away from him&mdash;could do more with the colored
voters down in Gooseville than any man, save Judge
Halliday, and he was out of politics. Hank Defrees,
of course, who still shivered under the fringe of a
ragged garment of respectability by clinging to a
heavily mortgaged home far out on Scioto Street,
where the better element of the town began to thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
out into social mediocrity, stood for the aristocratic
Third Ward, with its normal Republican majority
of two hundred and eleven. The Democrats had
never been able to make up a ward delegation in the
Third, and Defrees for years and years had sat in all
city and county conventions very much at large.</p>

<p>Such a defection, on the eve of election, was
serious, as every one recognized. Just after dinner,
on Sunday, Judge Halliday, who had disclaimed all
interest in the campaign, beckoned his son into the
parlor, darkened for secrets, and said to him in a
whisper that Mrs. Halliday plainly heard over the
banister of the staircase in the hall:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know that Hank Defrees and that Sullivan
boy and Gordon and old man Garwood, and
even Rice Murrell, are around working against
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>George gasped with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you know,&#8221; the father whispered on,
&#8220;that the Republicans have raised a corruption fund&mdash;five
hundred dollars, I understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard that,&#8221; said George, &#8220;must be getting
desperate, you fellows, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my son,&#8221; said the judge, with brows lowered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
&#8220;you know I would have absolutely nothing
to do with such a business as that. You know my
opinions on such things too well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course, father,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;that&#8217;s all
right. I know you wouldn&#8217;t countenance it&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I was just going to say,&#8221; the elder man continued,
&#8220;that while I do not agree with you, and
while I would not vote for you&mdash;at least, I do not
think I would&mdash;I was just going to say that if you
need any money yourself, to meet any of the&mdash;ah&mdash;legitimate
expenses of your campaign, why, just call
on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy grasped his father&#8217;s hand, and when he
could speak, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, father, thank you, but not now&mdash;it
isn&#8217;t worth it&mdash;but I&#8217;ll see what&#8217;s the matter with
these Indians, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>George went to his offices, over the People&#8217;s National
Bank and waited an hour in the rear room, a
dark and dingy room, with the dust of a country law
office deep on everything, and one ray of sunlight
scrambling in through the heavy shutters from the
alley. Then one after another, up the worn and
splintered stairs with tin signs of insurance agents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
and notaries public on every step, five men clambered.
They were grinning when they entered the
room, grinning and standing about awkwardly, all
save Hank Defrees, who was solemn and imponderable,
chewing his tobacco as gravely as if he were
making an appearance in court.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said George, standing in the middle of
the floor, &#8220;anything happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>The men all looked at one another, hesitating to
speak, but finally Scotty Gordon said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Happened! Well, I guess yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; queried George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he began, &#8220;now I done it, and last night
old Bill Williams hunted me up in Jake Fogarty&#8217;s
saloon, and, well, he offered me fifty dollars to use
if I wanted it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; Jerry Sullivan broke in&mdash;&#8220;Captain Bishop
offered me seventy-five.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And didn&#8217;t you take it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; said Jerry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you tell him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad&#8217;s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him,&#8221; he answered slowly, &#8220;that it
wouldn&#8217;t be a drop in the bucket.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>&#8220;Good for you,&#8221; said George. &#8220;And now, Mr.
Garwood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;don&#8217;t know as I got
much to say. Major Turner, though, &#8217;as &#8217;round to
my house this morning, an&#8217;&mdash;Well, he offered me
fifty dollars if I felt the way I had been reported,
and thought I could use it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Judge,&#8221; said George, turning to Defrees, &#8220;it&#8217;s
up to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lawyer took his tobacco in his fist and
chucked it away. &#8220;Joe Bogle,&#8221; he said, &#8220;told me he
knew where there&#8217;s a hundred for me if I could do
any good with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, doctor,&#8221; said Halliday, facing around to
the Reverend Mr. Murrell, who stood solemn in his
black garments and white tie, &#8220;what happened to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old negro glanced all around him cautiously
and even craned his neck to peer into the room beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, suh,&#8221; he began, &#8220;Judge Ernest &#8217;as out this
mornin&#8217; to hyah me preach, an&#8217; aftah service was
ovah, he drawed me to one side, and &#8217;gin to talk politics.
He ast me how I felt towa&#8217;ds you all, Mistuh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Halliday, an&#8217;&mdash;Ah didn&#8217; like to say it&mdash;but you
done tol&#8217; me, &#8217;membah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said George, urging the parson
out of his hesitation, &#8220;you made it strong, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wellum, Ah tol&#8217; the judge that Ah wasn&#8217; pow&#8217;ful
strong on you any moah, sense, Ah said, you all
hadn&#8217;t felt &#8217;sposed to help us &#8217;ith the subscription
fo&#8217; the new roof on ouah chu&#8217;ch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was clever,&#8221; said George, &#8220;damned clever&mdash;I
beg your pardon.&#8221; The old negro&#8217;s eyes had
widened till their whites showed, and he had raised
his hands, holding up his yellow palms before
George. &#8220;But go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, suh, the jedge &#8217;as al&#8217;ays had an interest in
ouah spiritual welfare, an&#8217; so he &#8217;lowed we&#8217;d ought
to be holpen out some.&#8221; The old man paused and
swallowed ceremoniously. &#8220;An&#8217; so, gen&#8217;lemen, he
offered me a hundred an&#8217; fifty dollahs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dark eyes of the old man shone with a
strange new luster.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, suh,&#8221; the preacher hesitated, &#8220;Ah took it.&#8221;</p>

<p>George brought his hand down on the parson&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
shoulder with a heavy slap and he laughed. &#8220;Good,
Bishop, good.&#8221;</p>

<p>They counted the money out on the table&mdash;exactly
four hundred and ninety dollars, the first campaign
fund Macochee had ever known. Then they
laughed and laughed and laughed.</p>

<p>When Halliday had laid his plans for the morrow&#8217;s
battle before his companions, he leaned back
in his chair and said, turning to the Reverend Rice
Murrell:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose, Bishop, that you approve of the
use of money in politics, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, <i>suh</i>,&#8221; the old preacher replied, with a smart
gravity, &#8220;an&#8217; somepin&#8217; done tol&#8217; me, yist&#8217;day, when
the jedge come to see me, that it &#8217;as jus&#8217; providential
that this much o&#8217; that filthy lucah &#8217;as removed
from corruptin&#8217; ouah &#8217;lections by bein&#8217; placed in
mah han&#8217;s.&#8221; His rolling eyes bulged and he dribbled
at the mouth as he fingered the pile of bills.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said George, &#8220;don&#8217;t put too big a roof on
the church, and remember&mdash;Gooseville&#8217;s going to
vote to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nevah you feah &#8217;bout Gooseville, mah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
brothah&mdash;she&#8217;ll be votin&#8217; early an&#8217; of&#8217;en to-morrah,
an&#8217; she&#8217;ll vote right.&#8221;</p>

<p>George Halliday was mayor of Macochee but one
term. That is a trick that has been played once in
every town in this free republic&mdash;but it can never
be played twice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A SECRET OF STATE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">OVER at the executive mansion, Governor
Chatham and his private secretary were at
dinner when the telegram came. The governor took
the yellow envelope from the butler&#8217;s tray and tore
it open. When he had read the message he passed it
over without a word to Gilman. The private secretary&#8217;s
eyes widened as he read it, and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim Lockhart dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>William, the black butler, stirred uneasily. The
governor bent forward, and lifted his coffee to his
lips. Gilman laid the despatch beside his plate, and,
still looking at it, began to pinch the golden tip of
a cigarette. William slid noiselessly to his side with
a match. When Gilman had lighted his cigarette
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Jim!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>The governor responded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, poor Jim.&#8221;</p>

<p>A strange quality in the governor&#8217;s tone gave expression
to something more than sadness. His face
was somber, immobile, inscrutable. He dropped his
napkin, and, without lighting his cigar, though William
stood by, shading the little flame of the ready
match with his pale palm, he rose and went slowly
into the library. About the walls were his beloved
books. On the broad, heavy table of Flemish oak a
shaded lamp rose over the magazines, the pamphlets,
the scattered books and the Chicago newspapers,
which reach Springfield at noon. In the wide
chimney&mdash;over which is carved those words from
the <i>Benedicte</i>, &#8220;Oh, ye Fire and Heat, Bless ye the
Lord&#8221;&mdash;a brazier of Sangamon County coal was
blazing. Outside a cold November rain was driving
against the tall windows of the mansion. The governor
sank into a deep leather chair. He supported
his head in his hand and gazed into the fire.</p>

<p>Gilman followed, and seating himself, likewise
fell into a melancholy reverie. The silence within,
and the wind sweeping the rain back and forth like
a broom without, oppressed him. He was a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
man. Once or twice he looked at the governor, and
then the silence, the wind and the rain forced him
to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seemed to be in perfect health when he went
away Wednesday,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The silence deepened. The wind threshed the
trees and the rain drenched the windows anew. Gilman
spoke again. He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The party&#8217;s lost a good man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I have lost another friend,&#8221; said the governor.
He was growing old.</p>

<p>Without moving, still gazing deeply into the coals,
after a little minute, he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;He was the most generous man I ever knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and I believe, after all, when the time came,
he would have been with you for the renomination.&#8221;
The governor stretched out his hand to stay Gilman&#8217;s
speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not thinking of that, Leonard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor did this gently, as he did all things.
Gilman&#8217;s face reddened&mdash;for the fire was growing
hot&mdash;and silence fell again between them. Gilman
felt the silence. He flung his cigarette into the fire.
Then he rose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll go over to the Leland,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some
of the boys may have particulars.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor nodded acquiescence, but as Gilman
reached the door that leads into the northwest drawing-room,
he spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Before you go hand me the statutes, if you
please. I suppose I have some duty to perform in
an event like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gilman who longed only for action, bore with
alacrity the three big calf-skin volumes to the library
table, and turned to the index.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find the section for you.&#8221; Gilman examined
the second volume for an instant, and then said:
&#8220;Here it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Read it, please,&#8221; said the governor.</p>

<p>And Gilman read: &#8220;&#8216;Section sixteen. In case of
the death of the treasurer, it shall be the duty of the
governor to take possession of the office of such
treasurer, and cause the vaults thereof to be closed
and securely locked, and so remain until a successor
is appointed and qualified; and at the time such successor
takes possession of the office, he, together
with the auditor of public accounts and any of the
bondmen of the deceased treasurer who shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
present, shall proceed to take an account of all
moneys, papers, books, records and other property
coming into his possession; and the auditor shall
take of such succeeding treasurer his receipt therefor
and keep the same on file in his office.&#8217; There,&#8221;
concluded Gilman, closing the book, and then immediately
reopening it, &#8220;that&#8217;s it&mdash;it&#8217;s chapter one
hundred and thirty, section sixteen of the act of
eighteen seventy-three, page twenty-three twenty-seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now turn,&#8221; said the governor, &#8220;to the chapter
on elections, chapter forty-six, I think it is, and see
what it says about the appointment of a successor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gilman tilted up the first volume, and inspected
the red and black labels on its back; then he turned
to chapter forty-six, and, running his finger down
the pages until he found the section, read hurriedly,
mumbling his words until he came to the vital sentence:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;When a vacancy shall occur in the office of secretary
of state, auditor of public accounts,&#8217; yes, here
it is&#8221; (he accentuated the word) &#8220;&#8216;<i>treasurer</i>, attorney-general,
superintendent of public instruction&#8217;&#8221;
(he was reading rapidly now and running words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
together) &#8220;&#8216;or member of the state board of equalization,
the governor&#8217;&#8221; (and now he raised his voice
and read more slowly and distinctly) &#8220;&#8216;the governor
shall fill the same by appointment, and the appointee
shall hold his office during the remainder of the
term, and until his successor is elected and qualified.&#8217;
That&#8217;s section hundred and twenty-eight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the governor, &#8220;I&#8217;ll name Hillman to
fill the vacancy.&#8221; Hillman was the treasurer-elect,
chosen by the people in November to succeed Lockhart.
He was not of the party, however, to which
the governor belonged. In Illinois, it will be remembered,
treasurers are elected not quadrennially, as
are the other state officials, but biennially, and a
treasurer can not succeed himself. So that in the
middle of an administration there is always an off
year, and a reaction, and as the papers say, a stinging
rebuke at the polls.</p>

<p>&#8220;M-m-yes,&#8221; said Gilman, &#8220;the boys won&#8217;t like it&mdash;but
it&#8217;s only for a couple of months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And as to sealing the treasury,&#8221; continued the
governor, &#8220;I presume that the morning will be time
enough for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a bad night outside, anyway,&#8221; responded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
Gilman. The governor was lost again in
thought. Gilman went on and out.</p>

<p>The governor, alone in the library, continued to
gaze into the fire. Once he took from the table at
his elbow a worn book, which he handled tenderly.
He read in it for a while. It was <i>The Thoughts of
Marcus Aurelius</i>. But he did not read long. Presently
he was sitting with the forefinger of one hand
between the leaves of the book, which lay in his lap,
musing on the fire again. Outside the rain drenched
the tall windows of the mansion.</p>

<p>The clock in the hall tolled eleven. The governor
rose, and went slowly up the staircase that winds
gracefully from the great hall to the floor above, and
thence to his chamber and his bed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a room on the parlor floor of the Leland, the
windows of which looked down on Sixth street, a
short, fat man was pacing the floor. His unbuttoned
waistcoat showed a white shirt stretched over a large
paunch. His hair was greased with perspiration, big
drops of which stood out on his forehead, and slid
down his pendulous, dewlapt cheeks. He had a
bristling mustache, at which he gnawed when he removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
his cigar from his lips, and a short goatee at
which he plucked incessantly with his fingers. When
his cigar was in his mouth, he rolled it about and
ground it between his teeth. At times he spat pieces
of the tobacco leaves fiercely into the grate. The
cigar was burning unevenly, and fuming so that the
little man winked his little eyes. On a table in the
room, littered with the inevitable Chicago papers,
and strewn with poker chips, stood an empty whisky
glass. The rumpled counterpane of the bed showed
that the little man had been tossing upon it. As he
paced up and down he talked to himself, and at times
swore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell,&#8221; he would say, &#8220;why the devil doesn&#8217;t he
come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Occasionally he would draw out his watch, and
scowl at its face. Then he would look at the old-fashioned
brass crank on the wall, beside the door,
which sometimes pulled a call-bell in the office below,
and sometimes did not, but he did not ring it. He
ran his fingers through his tumbled hair, and paced
up and down.</p>

<p>The little man was William Grigsby, and he was
the attorney-general of the state of Illinois. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
come down from the Jo Daviess hills, to serve a
term in the house, and been nominated for the office
he now held by the governor, John Chatham. John
Chatham was his political creator, and the two men
had once been friends. The administration had begun
harmoniously enough, but before two of the
four years of its political life had expired there was
a split, and factions had formed. There had been a
fierce fight for the control of the state central committee
that year, and the struggle had been carried
into the state convention, which nominated a state
treasurer, a superintendent of public instruction, and
trustees of the university of Illinois. In one faction
were the governor, the auditor of public accounts,
and, of course, his appointees, the adjutant-general,
the railroad and warehouse commissioners and the
trustees of the state institutions. In the other were
the attorney-general and the secretary of state, Jennings.
Lockhart, the state treasurer, had been neutral.
He was everybody&#8217;s friend. The lieutenant-governor
did not count. The superintendent of public
instruction was not a politician, save in teachers&#8217;
institutes, where he was cheered and indorsed in
classic resolutions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>And now Grigsby was an avowed candidate for
governor, in opposition to his old friend, John Chatham,
the man who had made him. Two years bring
about great changes in politics. Grigsby, in that
time, had grown corpulent, had hardened his liver
and his heart, and was threatened with Bright&#8217;s disease.</p>

<p>The attorney-general continued to smoke and pace
the floor, and swear. After a while he consulted
his watch again, and then gave the old-fashioned
brass bell-pull a vigorous jerk. Presently a negro
boy came bearing a presumptive pitcher of water,
the tinkling of the ice heralding his approach. The
attorney-general would have welcomed iced water
in the morning, but now he seized it from the black
boy&#8217;s hand, set it down with a splash on his wash-stand,
and shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and tell Jim to mix me a commodore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as the boy reached the door, it opened, and a
tall man entered. The tall man seeing the boy,
looked at Grigsby.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you have, Hank?&#8221; said the attorney-general.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little whisky.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>&#8220;Bring Mr. Jennings some whisky,&#8221; ordered the
attorney-general.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bourbon, boy,&#8221; added Mr. Jennings.</p>

<p>The boy withdrew.</p>

<p>The attorney-general paused before the fire, and
looked up into the face of the secretary of state.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Hank,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I began to fear you
hadn&#8217;t got my message. Heard the news?&#8221;</p>

<p>The secretary of state lazily pulled off his wet
overcoat and flung it across the bed, and then, shaking
the water from his broad-brimmed black slouch
hat in the careless way they have down in southern
Illinois, he tossed it after the coat, on which it fell
with a damp slap. He stood six feet in height, and
would have been taller had he not stooped. His face
was long, his skin dingy and sallow, and his thin
nose, beginning between deep-set eyes of steely blue,
stretched down the middle of his visage, and precipitated
itself over the black mustache that drooped
thin and moist about his mouth. His hair, glossy
black, though he was fifty, was flung straight across
his brow and over his left ear, giving the effect of a
mane. Behind, it greased the collar of a long black
frock coat that wrapped him lankly. A narrow black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
tie hung unknotted at his throat. When he moved
it was in that loose and lazy way that told, as his
hat and his habit did, that he came from the country
south of the old O. and M., which divides Egypt
from the corn lands of central Illinois. He drew a
rocking-chair to the grate, and stretching himself
comfortably in it, with his feet upon the ash-strewn
fender, drew from his hip pocket a plug of tobacco
and gnawed on it. Then he drawled, in a voice
haunted by musical echoes of southern ancestry:</p>

<p>&#8220;What news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; replied the attorney-general, &#8220;haven&#8217;t
you heard? Jim Lockhart&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The hell he is!&#8221; responded Jennings. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t
heerd ary word. When&#8217;d he die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sudden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was ailin&#8217; of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The attorney-general smiled, a peculiar, mirthless
smile.</p>

<p>The secretary of state ceased to rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t reckon now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it exactly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it&#8217;d got that bad. What&#8217;d they
give out fer the cause?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, heart failure, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beats hell, don&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The secretary of state was silent. Presently he
spoke again in an abstracted way:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Jim &#8217;as a devil of a good feller, as good as
you&#8217;d meet up &#8217;ith in a coon&#8217;s age. An&#8217; I reckon
when it come to a show-down, he &#8217;as our friend. If
the boys &#8217;p&#8217;ints an investigatin&#8217; committee&mdash;Jim &#8217;as
al&#8217;ays a leetle too free &#8217;ith the stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grigsby said &#8220;Yes,&#8221; in a detached tone. Then
there was silence for a space. The bell-boy knocked,
bore in his tray and departed. The men nodded over
the edges of their little glasses each to the other, and
drank. Then Grigsby, wiping his lips, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hank, I didn&#8217;t send for you to-night to hold
memorial services over Jim Lockhart. There&#8217;s something
more important than that&mdash;there&#8217;s something
damned important, and it concerns me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, me. I&#8217;m in this thing just twenty thousand
dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The hell you are!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>&#8220;Just&mdash;twenty&mdash;thousand&mdash;dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grigsby sank into a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Borrowed?&#8221; asked Jennings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Public funds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I don&#8217;t know. Course&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim Lockhart didn&#8217;t have no private fortune&mdash;&#8217;ithout
it &#8217;as the int&#8217;rust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, suppose it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217;thin&#8217; to show fer it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave him three notes&mdash;one for ten, two for five
thousand each.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a bigger damn fool than I gave you
credit fer bein&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>The attorney-general, clutching his fingers into
his hair, rested his elbows on his short knees, and
bowed his head. &#8220;And with the governorship just
in plain sight, too,&#8221; he groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it wasn&#8217;t so damn plain,&#8221; said Jennings.</p>

<p>Then as his eye rested on the man bowed beside
him, the sweat trickling down his tallow face, something
in the droop of the figure touched a chord of
pity in his heart, and the tall Egyptian laid a hand on
Grigsby&#8217;s shoulder, saying in another tone:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take on that way. Let&#8217;s see what can be
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s,&#8221; assented Grigsby.</p>

<p>The Egyptian knitted the brows over his long,
narrow nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hev you got any money?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I!&#8221; exclaimed Grigsby, with a sardonic grunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any property?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only my house up home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hain&#8217;t you any friends up there, any bankers
that&#8217;ll take care o&#8217; this thing fer you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Grigsby laughed ironically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cain&#8217;t you lay down on somebody fer it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Grigsby shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s your quo &#8217;arranto proceedin&#8217;s &#8217;gainst the
Chicago Consolidated?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t ripe yet,&#8221; said Grigsby, &#8220;and, anyhow,
there isn&#8217;t time. Damn it, man,&#8221; he said, raising his
voice, and striking his knee with his fist, &#8220;it&#8217;s got to
be done now, to-night, or I&#8217;m lost. The governor,
under the law, must seal the treasury at once, and
you know just how long John Chatham&#8217;ll wait.
We&#8217;ve got to take care of this thing to-night, to-night,
I tell you. That&#8217;s why I sent for you.&#8221; The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
attorney-general spoke angrily, and with a puffed
face that flushed an unhealthy red, and then added,
stretching forth his hand and laying it on Jennings&#8217;
knee, &#8220;You&#8217;re my friend, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said the secretary of state carelessly, and
then knitted his brows again. After a few minutes
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Bill, you and the governor used to be
friends, and he hain&#8217;t a bad feller, no-way. He got
you your nomination, you know&mdash;why don&#8217;t you go
to him&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to the governor?&#8221; cried Grigsby; &#8220;and tell
him&mdash;tell <i>him</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill,&#8221; said the secretary of state, &#8220;you don&#8217;t
know the governor. He hain&#8217;t my kind, ner I his&#8217;n,
but I&#8217;ll tell you one thing&mdash;he hain&#8217;t the man to take
advantage of a feller. You&#8217;d be as safe in his hands
as you would in mine&mdash;safer, maybe,&#8221; Jennings concluded,
with a good-humored chuckle.</p>

<p>Grigsby emphatically, doggedly, shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It never would do in this world,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you could get him to hold off till you could
take care of it. You and him used to be such friends&mdash;tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
him you&#8217;ll lay down fer the sake of old times&mdash;that&#8217;s
the thing&mdash;tell him an&#8217;thin&#8217; to get him to
hold off fer a few days. Then you&#8217;ll have time to
turn &#8217;round.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Jennings,&#8221; said Grigsby, straightening
up and glaring at the secretary of state, &#8220;Chatham&#8217;s
got all you fellows hypnotized. You think
he&#8217;s a little tin god, that he&#8217;s incapable of doing a
mean act, of throwing a friend down, or anything
of that sort. I tell you I know him better than all
of you do. He and I used to be close, thicker&#8217;n&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wasn&#8217;t borrowin&#8217; money out o&#8217; the state
treasury them days, though, was you, Bill?&#8221; interrupted
Jennings.</p>

<p>Grigsby colored.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you was somethin&#8217; of a reformer yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grigsby colored more deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; as fer the throwin&#8217; down&mdash;we know who
done the heft o&#8217; that. Course I don&#8217;t care&mdash;it suits
me&mdash;but give a houn&#8217; his dues.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grigsby&#8217;s color had changed by swift gradations
of tone to splenetic blackness. He broke in upon
Jennings&#8217; indictment of him, and his defense of the
governor:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>&#8220;Oh, drop that&mdash;let&#8217;s talk business. I tell you I
know Chatham, and I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to put myself in his
hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew out his watch and opened it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s half-past eight now, and he doubtless knows
Lockhart&#8217;s dead&mdash;probably he&#8217;s got the treasury
sealed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jennings&#8217; brow was gathered once more in
wrinkles that indicated thought. His face rapidly
assumed an expression of determination. Presently
he rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to do somethin&#8217; fer you
I wouldn&#8217;t do fer any other livin&#8217; man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grigsby raised an appealing, yearning face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yest&#8217;day I deposited in Gregory&#8217;s bank over at
Decatur twenty-four thousand dollars. It&#8217;s the fees
received in my office durin&#8217; the last quarter. It&#8217;s
lucky fer you they was unusually large&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grigsby, and his expression, expectant
and hopeful a moment before, clouded, &#8220;but it&#8217;s in
Decatur, and we&#8217;re in Springfield and we&#8217;ve got to
have it now, to-night, if it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to do us any good.
What the devil did you want to deposit it in Gregory&#8217;s
bank for?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;Because,&#8221; replied Jennings, &#8220;Gregory&#8217;s rich, and
a contributor, an&#8217; he can deliver Macon County, and
we&#8217;ll want Macon County&#8217;s ten votes, if I hain&#8217;t mistaken,
one of these days. But never mind that now&mdash;it&#8217;s
the on&#8217;y thing we can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jennings looked at his watch. &#8220;It&#8217;s now twenty-five
till nine. A train goes out on the Wabash at
nine-five. I&#8217;ll send Hennessey over on that train
with a note to Gregory, an&#8217; a check. He can get
twenty thousand, an&#8217; ketch a train back &#8217;bout eleven-twenty,
I think, anyway&mdash;that train that gets here at
twelve-forty. You can take the money, put it back
in the treasury, &#8217;fore the governor seals &#8217;er up,
an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Grigsby sprang toward Jennings and seized his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hank, you&#8217;re the best friend I ever had,&#8221; he
cried, and his eyes glistened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, don&#8217;t talk like that,&#8221; said Jennings awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But can we trust Hennessey?&#8221; said Grigsby, the
next instant, his eyes dilating, his hand suddenly
dropping by his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell, we&#8217;ve got to,&#8221; said Jennings. Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
strode across the room and turned the old-fashioned
brass bell-pull.</p>

<p>When a black boy grinned in the doorway, Jennings
sent for Hennessey, and soon, the old elevator
having clambered to the parlor floor, there was a
knock. Jennings yelled &#8220;Come!&#8221; and in the doorway
stood a young Irishman, red-cheeked and with
closely-cropped, silver-sprinkled black hair. In the
cities, the hair of the Irish-American&mdash;especially in
politics, and they are all in&mdash;turns gray early. Hennessey
was strong in the Thirteenth Ward of Chicago,
hence his job in the office of the secretary of
state. Jennings had been writing while awaiting
the Irishman&#8217;s coming. Turning to him the secretary
of state gave his instructions, and he departed.
As he closed the door Grigsby called:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it all right with you, Mike.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grigsby went to the window and pressed his face
to one of the small panes, placing his hands as blinds
beside his eyes as a little child does. The cold glass
soothed his forehead deliciously. He saw Shorty,
who has driven &#8220;statesmen&#8221; on their mysterious
nightly rounds for generations, mount the box of his
old hack and pull his reluctant horses into the street.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
Then he turned to confront the three hours&#8217; wait.
He poked the smouldering fire of soft prairie coal,
gave Jennings a cigar, and was about to pull the old-fashioned
brass bell crank that more cheer might be
added to the factitious comfort he sought to create
in the room, when Jennings, meditatively scratching
his head, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill, where&#8217;s them notes o&#8217; yourn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, in the treasury, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll have to get some one who can open
the vaults fer you to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grigsby&#8217;s brow darkened, and the small cheerfulness
that had begun to adumbrate itself in his face
faded quite away.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so&mdash;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pondered heavily and then said, the old note
of fear in his tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has that vault a time lock?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Grigsby presently, breaking the silence,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to get Mendenhall.&#8221; Mendenhall
was the assistant state treasurer, and was counted
among the adherents of Grigsby.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>&#8220;Better let me go,&#8221; said Jennings, taking up his
coat and hat.</p>

<p>When he had gone Grigsby again paced the floor.
Now he would pause at the window and look down
into Sixth Street, where the rain, falling hopelessly
and helplessly, was making pools in the depressions
of the cedar block pavement that glinted in the white
glare of the arc light spluttering before the hotel.
Whenever the hoarse sounds of distant locomotive
whistles came to him out of the wet night, he jerked
forth his watch and sighed as he replaced it. Then
he began to worry because Jennings did not reappear.
He wondered if Governor Chatham would
venture out in such a night to seal the treasury. He
cursed Chatham, who had made him, and finally
Jennings, who had saved him. Altogether, he passed
a very bad two hours. And then Jennings returned.
As the tall Egyptian entered the room, Grigsby demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over to the St. Nick&mdash;met up &#8217;ith some o&#8217; the
boys, an&#8217; set into a little game fer a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See Mendenhall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep&mdash;he&#8217;ll be &#8217;long. Gosh! it&#8217;s a regular Shawneetown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
flood outside!&#8221; And the man waved his
big hat in a wide arc, the spray from it spitting
angrily as it sprinkled the fire in the grate.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s all right, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ump huh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the time lock?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, George says they don&#8217;t never use that&mdash;haven&#8217;t
sence the day the senate &#8217;p&#8217;inted that committee
to count the money in the treasury. &#8217;Member?
By gosh, didn&#8217;t pore ol&#8217; Jim hustle to get a special
train an&#8217; haul that money down from Chicago,
though?&#8221;</p>

<p>The secretary of state wagged his long head and
chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That thing lost him e&#8217;enamost fifty thousan&#8217; in
int&#8217;rust, he tol&#8217; me onct,&#8221; the secretary of state went
on, &#8220;an&#8217; he hain&#8217;t never been able sinct to make ary
long loan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he laughed, and, the spirit of reminiscence
being upon him, he went on: &#8220;One time &#8217;fore the
war, the legislature &#8217;p&#8217;inted a countin&#8217; committee,
an&#8217; ol&#8217;&mdash;oh, what&#8217;s &#8217;is name?&mdash;you know&mdash;from
Gallatin County&mdash;he &#8217;as treasur&#8217; then, an&#8217; the&#8217; wasn&#8217;
more&#8217;n about fifty thousan&#8217; in the safe, but he &#8217;as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
game, an&#8217; when the committee &#8217;peared next mornin&#8217;,
he says, &#8216;Cert&#8217;n&#8217;y, gentlemen,&#8217; an&#8217; handed &#8217;em out
about ten thousan&#8217; in them old green dollar bills, an&#8217;
says: &#8216;When yo&#8217;re done countin&#8217; o&#8217; <i>them &#8217;ere</i>, I&#8217;ll
give you all some more.&#8217; An&#8217; in &#8217;bout an hour they
reckoned they&#8217;d take <i>his</i> figur&#8217;s&mdash;they&#8217;d have to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grigsby&#8217;s heart lightened, and he became almost
gay, ordering much drink. And for an hour the two
men sat there, waiting and smoking, and drinking
whisky&mdash;Jennings bourbon and Grigsby rye&mdash;and
were content. Though every time the yowl of a
locomotive was borne to him on the cold, wet night,
Grigsby jerked out his watch. And once he started
at a short knock on the door, but it was only Mendenhall.</p>

<p>After midnight Grigsby&#8217;s anxiety deepened, and
he ceased to pay attention to Jennings&#8217; stories of
politics down in &#8220;southern Eellinoy,&#8221; stories about
Don Morrison and John A. Logan. At twelve-forty
he rose and trod the floor, but Jennings&#8217; long form
was stretched out before the fire, his whisky glass
was at his elbow, and he said from time to time:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, fer God&#8217;s sake, Bill, set down&mdash;they&#8217;ll be
&#8217;long all right.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the Wabash?&#8221; said Grigsby, cocking
his head at the night cry of a locomotive.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217; know,&#8221; said Jennings, who was growing
mellow, &#8220;on&#8217;y whistles I could ever tell was them on
the ol&#8217; O. and M., &#8217;ceptin&#8217; o&#8217; course, the toot of the
<i>Three States</i>, which is now at Cairo, ef she hain&#8217;t
stuck on a mud bank over on the Mizzouri shore
some&#8217;er&#8217;s &#8217;round Bird&#8217;s Landin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grigsby looked at his watch. It was ten minutes
of one, and just as he dolefully announced the hour
the door opened, and Hennessey entered, carrying a
leather traveling-bag. Grigsby leaped toward him,
his itching fingers outstretched to seize the valise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it all there?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me for a thief?&#8221; replied Hennessey, swinging
the bag behind him.</p>

<p>Hennessey proffered the bag to his master, but
Jennings said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute.&#8221; Then he ran his hand wrist-deep
into his pocket and drew out a paper, which he
examined critically, squinting his eyes, partly to protect
them from the smoke that curled up from a big
domestic cigar, partly&mdash;as it seemed, to assist in the
concentration of his thoughts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>&#8220;Gineral,&#8221; he said&mdash;by some strange confusion of
ideas, down in Springfield they give the attorney-general
a military title, which custom that functionary
fosters&mdash;&#8220;Gineral, will you give me your signature
to that, &#8217;fore you start?&#8221;</p>

<p>Grigsby glowered at Jennings, read the paper,
said somewhat petulantly, &#8220;Oh, of course,&#8221; and hesitatingly
signed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Hennessey,&#8221; said Jennings, carefully placing
the paper in a long pocket-book he drew from the
region of his left hip.</p>

<p>Hennessey held the bag out toward the secretary
of state.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jennings, who was pouring himself a
drink, &#8220;give it to the gineral.&#8221;</p>

<p>The attorney-general took the bag and opened it.
Inside were four big bundles of bank bills. He lifted
them out. Each bundle was composed of ten smaller
packages, held by rubber bands, and each package
was bound with a pink paper strap neatly pinned and
marked &#8220;five hundred.&#8221; He counted and replaced the
packages in the bag. Then taking his coat and hat, he
turned to Jennings and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s be gone.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>The secretary of state rolled his head toward the
attorney-general, waved his long arm and flapped
his hand fin-like at him, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait here, Mike and me. You won&#8217;t need
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The attorney-general scowled, and then went out,
accompanied only by the assistant state treasurer.
Hurrying down Capitol Avenue, Grigsby shivered,
glancing up dark alleys.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The clock in the hall of the executive mansion had
struck the half-hour after midnight, and the governor
was descending the stairs in a gray bath-robe
and slippers. The old house was dark and still.
Even the room occupied by Gilman, who should, at
that hour, have been reading the magazines in bed,
showed no light. The governor, softly treading,
entered the library. The last embers of the fire were
smouldering. The governor lighted the lamp, and
in the circle of soft light it spread on the library
table, he bent over a book, his glasses on his nose,
their cord hanging down into his lap. He turned the
leaves of the book. It was not <i>The Thoughts of
Marcus Aurelius</i>. It was the second volume of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
<i>The Revised Statutes of Illinois</i>, a stupid work
which many men consult, laboriously, far into the
night. He softly rustled over the leaves until he
found chapter one hundred and thirty. He ran his
finger down the pages till it stopped at section sixteen.
And then he read very slowly: &#8220;In case of
the death of the treasurer, it shall be the duty of the
governor to take possession of the office of such
treasurer and cause the vaults thereof to be closed
and securely locked, and so remain until&mdash;&#8221; He read
the words again, and again a third time, and yet
again.</p>

<p>He closed the book, put out the lamp and slowly
felt his way back up the stairs.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he descended again, and groping
in the hall, drew a greatcoat over his broad
shoulders, covered his head with the slouch hat he
wore when he went down into southern Illinois, and
let himself out of the wide front door. The asphalt
driveway that flings its long curve through the
grounds of the gubernatorial residence from Fifth
Street to Fourth, gleamed like the surface of a river
at night. The rain no longer fell, but the trees
dripped dismally. Across the low night sky black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
clouds were flying. The governor walked down the
driveway to the big iron gates at Fourth Street,
whose watered surface as far as he could see,
wavered under the electric lights at the crossings.
The governor turned at Jackson Street and walked
down the sleeping little avenue toward Second
Street. Before a low brown house trickling its eaves
behind two sentinel cedars, he halted. He went up
the moist brick walk, and pulled the white bell-knob.
The bell jangled harshly upon the sleeping stillness.
The jangling trembled away. He rang again. There
was a reluctant stir within and a voice, a scared
woman&#8217;s voice, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The governor,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;Is Mr. Mendenhall
at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman slid back bolts and opened the door
circumspectly. She thrust out a towsled head and
shoulders wrapped in a shawl. The governor heard
a baby&#8217;s cry. The woman&#8217;s teeth chattered with
nervousness and the cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir; he hasn&#8217;t got in yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor thanked her and turned away. The
woman opened the door wide and watched him as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
retreated down the moist brick walk. At the street
he paused. Then he turned on toward Second Street.
The woman closed the door, and her key grated in
the lock.</p>

<p>The governor strode on into Second Street, past
the residence of the Bishop of Springfield, standing
behind white pillars deep in its naked grove, past St.
Agatha&#8217;s Seminary sleeping in its gloom, until he
reached the state house. The brooding building
loomed above him, dark and dour, heaving its great
gray dome into the grim night. Huge granite pillars
lifted themselves above him, he was lost in the
shades of the lofty portico. He unlocked and pushed
open the heavy door. The great marble corridors
were dark and echoed to the touch of his heel upon
the stones. In the wide rotunda, under the enormous
dome, thick with billowing gloom, a janitor, the
people&#8217;s solitary night watch, slept profoundly in his
chair, his mouth open, his white beard upon his
breast. His gossips had departed. Their deserted
chairs stood aimlessly about. He had finished the
nightly recital of the strenuous part he had borne in
the great rebellion, and he slumbered, his snores
echoing in the monstrous inverted bowl above him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
The governor ascended to the floor above, and
turned down the north corridor. A golden bar of
light was thrown across the marble floor. It
streamed from the open door of the state treasury.
The governor quickened his steps. He heard the
lunge of huge bolts as they were tumbled home. He
heard the dull spin of a combination lock, and as he
reached the treasury two men were emerging from
the dark vaults.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, that&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentence was lost in the mouth of the attorney-general
of the state of Illinois, who stood with
dropping jaw staring at the governor. The attorney-general
stood motionless, and then plunged a hand
with three pieces of paper into an outer pocket of his
overcoat. Mendenhall stood behind him, a flame
flashing over his face.</p>

<p>The governor was the first one to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, gentlemen,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The two men did not reply, and the governor
spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under the law, gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the duty
devolves upon me of closing and locking the treasury
and temporarily assuming possession of it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>Still the men did not reply. The tissues of
Grigsby&#8217;s face had become flaccid, and a greenish
shade had overspread them. His eyes had contracted
to sharp points under angry brows. The governor
scrutinized the two men closely, as he advanced, and
said, speaking in a calm tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;And so, if you gentlemen have concluded your
business&#8221;&mdash;he paused&mdash;&#8220;I shall proceed to the execution
of that duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; he added, a moment afterward, &#8220;perhaps
fortunate in finding you here, Mr. Mendenhall. You
may be able to assist me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew toward them, and they stood aside. He
entered the vaults where a gas-jet glimmered, its
light glinting on the nickel-plated knobs of the great
steel doors. He tried the doors. They were locked.
He remained an instant in thought, and then took
from his pocket a stick of red sealing-wax. He hesitated
another instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the great seal could not be
utilized.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great seal of state of the state of Illinois,
though it has a political history, is, nevertheless,
physically, but a huge overgrown seal such as notaries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
public use in their little businesses. And in Illinois
the governor has no privy seal as he has in some
commonwealths. The governor warmed the sealing-wax
in the gas-jet that blazed beside him in the vault.
When it began to melt he dribbled and daubed its
softened substance, drop by drop, on the combination
of the huge safe, as a girl would seal a letter.
When he had quite covered the lock with the molten
wax, he sealed it with the seal ring he wore on his
left hand, a ring which bore the coat-of-arms of a
colonial governor. The midnight secret of those
two men, whatever it might be, was either safe with
them or more safely still, sealed with other secrets
behind those massive doors. And then he turned
the gas down until only a tiny star blinked in the
vault, and came out, and swung together the big
steel gates that clanked like prison bars, their locks
snapping automatically.</p>

<p>He returned to the outer door of the department
and placed his hand upon the knob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said ceremoniously, &#8220;I await
your pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent his gaze full upon William Grigsby, and
that little man, throwing back his head with something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
like defiance, strode on his short legs out of the
high-ceiled room, and Mendenhall followed him, but
meekly. As they filed past, Grigsby, with face upturned,
a face that now in anger had taken on the
blue tinge of butchered beef, drew his hands from his
overcoat pocket and clasped them behind his back.
The governor bowed as the little man and Mendenhall
swept out before him. And then he drew the
big walnut door to.</p>

<p>Standing out in the corridor Grigsby waited, and
as he stood and waited, he fumbled in the outer
pocket of his overcoat. Suddenly he drew forth his
hand. His face had turned white, the white of a
fish&#8217;s belly.</p>

<p>As the governor drew the big walnut door to, and
as it swung behind him, it pushed before it, scraping
with the peevish voice of a ratchet along the matted
floor, a piece of crumpled paper. Grigsby, who had
turned toward Mendenhall with a look of death&#8217;s
despair, saw it, and started, a faint ray of hope
beaming in his eye. But the paper lay under the governor&#8217;s
feet.</p>

<p>The governor closed the doors.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may lock them, Mr. Mendenhall,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>The assistant state treasurer drew a jingling
bunch of keys from his pocket and locked the door.
Grigsby&#8217;s eyes were fastened on the paper at the
governor&#8217;s feet. His heart was swelling in his
throat. His fingers were twitching, and he was
sweating like a stoker. At Mendenhall&#8217;s approach
the governor placed his foot upon the paper. When
Mendenhall had done, the governor picked it up. He
smoothed it out in his fingers, and slowly adjusted
his glasses. By the dim light that always burns at
night just outside the door of the state treasury he
read it. Then he placed it in the pocket of his overcoat.
He kept his hand upon it. The blue of
Grigsby&#8217;s face deepened.</p>

<p>The three men went down the stairs, the governor
standing aside at the top to let them precede him.
They crossed the rotunda, past the slumbering janitor
whose snores ascended and exploded in the
rounded blackness of the hollow dome, down the
east corridor and so out into the darkness. They
walked together down the wide stone walk, the stone
walk as wide as a street, that sweeps, with a strip of
sward down its middle, across the state house lawns
to Capitol Avenue. The governor did not turn up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Second Street by the way he had come. He kept on
with his two companions, and all three were silent.
Not a word had any one of them spoken. They were
drowned in thought. It matters not of what the
assistant state treasurer was thinking. He held only
an appointive office. He was a political villain, and
had a collar on his neck. The attorney-general was
thinking of days that were to come. The governor
was thinking of days that were gone. Silent,
thoughtful, thus they kept on up Capitol Avenue.
When they approached the shades that gathered
under the ugly iron bridge which spans the ragged
street that leads to the capitol of Illinois, the Alton&#8217;s
St. Louis Limited came plunging through the town,
half an hour late. The three men halted. The great
mysterious, vestibuled train, with its darkly curtained
Pullmans, slid across the bridge. As they
stood waiting for it to pass that they might go under,
the governor withdrew his hand from his pocket,
the paper still folded in it. He held the paper out
toward Grigsby.</p>

<p>&#8220;William,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I think you dropped something.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE COLONEL&#8217;S LAST
CAMPAIGN</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALL day long Colonel Talbott sat in his leather
chair in the lobby of the Grand, twiddling his
cane, smoking his cigar, and talking politics. Under
the broad brim of his black slouch hat his hair fell
in silver wisps almost to his shoulders, and the long
mustache, drooping like a Georgian&#8217;s at the corners
of his mouth, was as white as his hair, save at the
spot where his cigar had tinged it yellow.</p>

<p>There was not a politician of either party between
Dunleith and Cairo who was not proud to bend over
the old fellow&#8217;s chair, take his thin hand and say:
&#8220;Hello, Colonel, what&#8217;s new in politics?&#8221; The
colonel had one invariable reply: &#8220;I&#8217;m out of politics,
and don&#8217;t know anything. What do you hear?&#8221;
Sometimes, if the passing politician happened to be
of the old day, the colonel would take him by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
arm, and they would saunter away to the bar. If the
politician came from northern Illinois, the colonel
would take rye; if from southern Illinois the colonel
would take bourbon; such was his idea of etiquette.
Though never would he take a drink before breakfast,
for a drink before breakfast, he told Carroll,
was a back log in the fire that would burn the live-long
day.</p>

<p>Carroll was the staff of the colonel&#8217;s old age.
The two would sit by the hour, while the old man
talked of the Nineteenth Illinois Cavalry, of Lincoln
and Douglas, of David Davis and Elijah Haines,
of state and national conventions, in the days when
he had made and unmade congressmen, governors
and senators, ruling his party in the state, Carroll
shrewdly thought, with a discipline as rigid as that
with which he had welded the Nineteenth Illinois
into a fighting regiment.</p>

<p>To those who knew the veteran&#8217;s history, his love
for the boy was touching. The story is too long to
tell now, but its essential motif must always be the
ingratitude of Si Warren. The colonel had picked
Warren up in the old Fifteenth District, sent him
to Congress, and finally made a United States senator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
of him. Warren, developing quickly as a politician,
had turned around, defeated the colonel for
re&euml;lection as chairman of the state executive committee,
a position he had held for sixteen years, had
frozen him out of the Arizona deal, and somehow
caused the colonel&#8217;s only son to go wrong out there
in Tucson. The boy&#8217;s mother had died; of a broken
heart, they said. Since then a decade had passed, a
decade which the colonel had spent in the grim lonesomeness
of a crowded hotel. He never mentioned
Warren&#8217;s name. If he heard it, he clenched his bony
fists so tightly that the knuckles showed white. Once
a year, perhaps, in the springtime, when the state
central committee met, he got out his white waistcoat
and was invited up to the ordinary to make a
speech on the state of the party, and once a year, in
the summertime, he attended a reunion of his regiment,
now decimated to a squadron of tottering old
men, whom the colonel called &#8220;boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spring came, rolling up from the muddy Ohio,
showering its apple blossoms in the orchards of
Egypt, sprinkling with purple flowers the prairies
of central Illinois, and finally flooding with tardy
sunshine the cold waters of Lake Michigan. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
the year the legislature that chose Warren&#8217;s successor
in the senate was to be elected, and when the
senator came home from Washington he found his
fences in sad repair. The Silas Warren of the parlor
suite in a Lake Front hotel was not the Si Warren
whom Colonel Talbott had rescued from the dusty
little law office down in Shelbyville fifteen years before.
The clothes of that time were faded by the sun
in which he loafed all day on the post-office corner,
whereas the clothes of this spring morning bespoke
a New York tailor and a valet.</p>

<p>The senator was not in a pleasant mood. There
was opposition to his re&euml;lection, and while his
machine ignored it, and while George R. Baldwin,
the lawyer who watched the interests of certain big
corporations during the sessions of the legislature,
said it was but a sporadic demonstration of soreheads,
back-numbers and labor skates, it was spreading,
as the picturesque politicians from the corn
lands of central Illinois would say, like a prairie fire.
Jacksonville, where the standard of revolt had first
been raised, was in Morgan, the colonel&#8217;s home
county, and so it came to pass that the defection was
laid to the machinations of the colonel himself. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
yet, as the politicians who were always dropping into
Chicago to correct their reckonings, paused an instant
by the leather chair, the old white head would
slowly wag from side to side, and the old man would
say:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m out of politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Carroll had not conceived the idea of running
for office, perhaps the colonel would have remained
out of politics, but the boy, after a week of dreaming,
dramatized himself as making a speech in the
state senate chamber at Springfield. The colonel, as
a man&#8217;s duty is, advised him to keep out of politics,
and yet within an hour after Carroll shyly confessed
his ambition, the fever awoke in the old fellow&#8217;s
bones, his eyes flamed with the old fire, and he
admitted that the experience might help a boy who
was struggling in a pitiless city for a law practice.</p>

<p>Within a week the colonel had introduced Carroll
to Superintendent of Street and Alley Cleaning Patrick
F. Gibbons, who promised to be with him, and
had taken him to the city hall for an audience with
the mayor. After that the newspapers said that
John D. Carroll had been slated for the senatorial
nomination in the First District.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>When Warren learned of the colonel&#8217;s new interest
in the campaign, he cunningly decided to utilize it
by throwing his strength to Carroll in the First, provided
the colonel would withdraw his opposition.
He prided himself on being a man who harbored no
resentments. So he sent Dan Ford, his private secretary,
to open negotiations for peace.</p>

<p>The colonel had recognized the coming of the heat
by donning his suit of linen, with a red tie at his
throat to give the touch of color he always loved,
and he had got out his broad-leaved Panama hat for
its fifteenth season. Ford found him seated in the
leather chair, swinging one thin leg over the other,
his white hose wrinkling over his low shoes, telling
Carroll how Grant came to Springfield from Galena
seeking a commission in the army. Ford diplomatically
broached the subject of a conference between
the colonel and the senator. The colonel heard him
to the end, but said nothing. His mustache simply
lifted a little with the curl of his lip. Ford was evidently
disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any reply?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;or any message?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the colonel, and his gray eyes flashed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
under their shaggy brows. &#8220;Present my compliments
to Senator Warren, and tell him that if he
ever presumes to speak to me again in all his life, I&#8217;ll
slap his face, and if he resents it, I&#8217;ll kill him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ford tried to bow, and the colonel, turning to
Carroll, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;As I was saying, General Palmer happened to go
into the adjutant-general&#8217;s office and saw Grant
smoking a corn-cob pipe and working away on muster
rolls at a broken table propped up in one corner
of the room. The old forage cap he had worn in
the Mexican War was lying on the table. It was the
only hat he had in those days.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning an interview with Warren appeared
in all the papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would prefer,&#8221; the senator was reported as saying,
&#8220;to retire to private life and resume my interrupted
law practice, if I were not compelled to seek
vindication by the bushwhacking of this doting old
ingrate, who, disappointed in his attempts to monopolize
patronage that belongs to patriotic party
workers, now skulks behind the sympathy his years
and infirmities excite, to wage a guerrilla warfare.&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel read the interview at breakfast. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
sat at the table with one paper propped up before him
and four others beside his plate, his eye-glasses on
his nose, and ate his oatmeal and his beefsteak and
his boiled eggs just as he did on every morning of
the year. Then he drank the half cup of coffee that
he always reserved, with its cream slowly coagulating
at the surface, for the end of his meal, because it
was cooler then, laid his napkin down and shuffled
slowly out.</p>

<p>Half an hour later a man stopped by his chair
in the lobby and said something to the colonel that
made him drop his paper, and look up over his eye-glasses
with a scowl. The man was known as Birdy
Quinn, and he had lost his job in the water office the
week before, because Warren wished to make room
for a fellow who could deliver more votes at the
coming primaries than Birdy could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; the colonel asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! Isn&#8217;t it all over the ward this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure that Pat Gibbons consented to run
as Warren&#8217;s candidate for state senator in the First
District against Carroll&mdash;after promising me&mdash;<i>me</i>?&#8221;
He bent his brows angrily and pointed with a long
forefinger at his own breast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>&#8220;Well, hell&#8217;s bells!&#8221; said Quinn. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t Baldwin
working with him half the night?&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel took his glasses from his nose and
swinging them by their heavy cord, blinked with his
old eyes at the square of sunlight blazing in the
Clark Street entrance, across which, as on a vividly
illuminated screen, the crowds on the sidewalk flitted
like trembling figures in a kinetoscope. Presently he
lifted himself heavily from his chair and gathered
up his newspapers and his stick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Birdy,&#8221; he said wearily, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ve got
one more fight left in me.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Most men thought it was Warren&#8217;s interview that
caused the colonel to consent at last to lead the opposition
against him, though some said it was but
the fascination of politics, which is like the fascination
of the sea, so that a man who follows it once
must follow it till he dies.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought I&#8217;d live to see the day when I&#8217;d
be glad to find the old man&#8217;s chair empty,&#8221; said Eph
Harkness, of Macoupin, that afternoon. He had
come up from Carlinville in response to a telegram
from the colonel, and having registered, and given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
his bag and linen duster to a bell-boy, was removing
his big felt hat to mop his wet brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he won&#8217;t be able to stand the strain of
a campaign,&#8221; said Carroll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand the strain! Him?&#8221; exclaimed Harkness.
&#8220;Why, he&#8217;ll be alive and drawing pay when they&#8217;re
referring to Si Warren as ex-senator!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate to have them say such mean things about
him,&#8221; Carroll persisted, thinking of the interview.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they think they kin say any meaner things
&#8217;bout him than he kin &#8217;bout them, jes&#8217; let &#8217;em lam
in,&#8221; chuckled Mosely, of Alexander.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; mused Harkness, &#8220;it&#8217;ll be the greatest fight
we&#8217;ve had in Illinois since Logan&#8217;s time. We&#8217;ve
got a leader now.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an echo of the old days in his voice,
which, with its gentle hint of regret, was lost on
Carroll, who had not known the colonel in the old
days.</p>

<p>They found the colonel in his room, sitting by
an open window, his Panama hat on his head, his
cigar in his teeth, and his walking-stick twirling in
his long fingers. The room did not present that
orderly and cool appearance it had on the few occasions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
when Carroll had been in it before. The
shades were high at the window, admitting flames of
heat, wads of crumpled paper bestrewed the floor,
a huge table had been brought in and it was
already littered with newspapers and telegraph
blanks. The bureau had been moved, the tall white
door it had hidden so long had been unlocked, and
Carroll heard the incessant clicking of a typewriter
in the adjoining room. Two or three men sat idly
about, gossiping, as men will, about political battles
of the past. There seemed to be none of the industry
of politics apparent, though political headquarters
seldom do display that, perhaps because a
good part of the industry of politics consists in talking
and smoking and drinking, and partly, perhaps,
because of the necessity of concealment that always
exists. These men were gathered to organize the
defeat of a crafty and unscrupulous man who had
a national, state and city machine at his command,
with money to heart&#8217;s desire, and yet they sat and
smoked, stirring only when a telegram came from
down the state, or some long-forgotten politician
came in to offer himself as a recruit.</p>

<p>For a month the colonel did not go out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
hotel. He was up early and at work, his cigar in
his mouth, dictating letters, sending telegrams, receiving
callers. When he slept, no one knew. He
never had his hat off. He ate his meals from a tray
in his room, after the food had grown cold. His
headquarters recalled pathetically the old days when
his power and supremacy were unquestioned. They
were crowded day and night with the back-numbers
and the soreheads Baldwin had talked about,
who came with their grievances, their impossible
schemes, their paltry ambitions. Of such stuff
the colonel had to make his machine, flattering,
threatening, wheedling, soothing jealousies, reconciling
discordant factions, healing old animosities,
inflaming new hatreds, keeping up spirit in faint
hearts, leaving not a wire unpulled. He appointed
a steering committee, on which were Mosely, of
Alexander; Garwood, of Kankakee; Harkness, of
Macoupin, and Malachi Nolan; he wrote personal
letters to old friends in every school district in the
state, and thus, slowly, patiently, laboriously welded
his organization together. What he most needed was
funds, and a candidate to provide funds; lacking
them, he insisted that this was not a movement for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
the profit of any one man, but for the good of the
party alone, and so invested it with the enthusiasm
of what passes for patriotism in a nation where party
is set above country. He told the landlord of the
Grand that he would be responsible for the rent of
the two rooms he had engaged next his own. He already
owed the landlord.</p>

<p>The night before the primaries a crowd, foul with
the reek of tobacco, alcohol and perspiration, was
shuffling about in the hall and anterooms of the
colonel&#8217;s headquarters. The crowd was noisy, profane
and confident. But inside, the steering committee
was assembled, and it was very sober. Garwood,
at the littered table, had been scratching his head
over political equations.</p>

<p>Conventions had been held in all the thirty-six
outside districts, and sixty-nine candidates had been
nominated, fifty-five representatives and fourteen
senators. Of these they could depend upon twenty-nine.
It requires fifty-two to control a legislative
caucus, when the party has a bare majority on joint
ballot, so they would have to nominate at least
twenty-three of their candidates in Cook County to
get a caucus majority, assuming the ultimate election<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
of them all. Fifty-seven candidates were to
be selected in Cook County on the morrow. Of
them, they should name at least thirty-five to be entirely
safe. In other words, they must carry Cook
County.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that countin&#8217; hold-over senators?&#8221; asked
Mosely, when Garwood was done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, counting the hold-overs&mdash;Warren claims
fourteen out of the seventeen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Josh Badger never&#8217;ll vote for him,&#8221; said Mosely.</p>

<p>&#8220;He gives us Josh,&#8221; Garwood replied. &#8220;Bates
and Halliday are uncertain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so damned uncertain,&#8221; said Mosely.
&#8220;They&#8217;re only waitin&#8217; to be seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Warren&#8217;ll get them easy enough,&#8221; said Harkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re cheap,&#8221; Mosely assented, spitting
across the room at an iron cuspidor. &#8220;&#8217;Bout eight
dollars apiece, I&#8217;d guess &#8217;em off at,&#8221; he added, with
a poor man&#8217;s contempt for low prices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that only makes it worse,&#8221; replied Garwood.
&#8220;But leave them out entirely. With sixty-two
votes Warren can control the caucus&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Providin&#8217; al&#8217;ays, however,&#8221; suggested Mosely,
in statutory language.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;Oh, course,&#8221; assented Garwood, petulant from
the heat and the situation, &#8220;they won&#8217;t all be elected.
That&#8217;s why he&#8217;ll work like hell to carry Cook. He
lies when he says he doesn&#8217;t give a damn how she
goes to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He always does that,&#8221; said the colonel, from his
bed.</p>

<p>Carroll, to whom political calculations savored
always of the mystery of higher mathematics, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me you could figure it better than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you try it,&#8221; said Garwood, dropping his
pencil and tilting back in his chair.</p>

<p>There was not much hope, and the soberness
deepened. After a while there was a knock on the
door, and a shaven head was thrust in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Them lit&#8217;ry guys is out here,&#8221; said the shaven
head. &#8220;Any figur&#8217;s to give out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Figur&#8217;s?&#8221; cried Mosely. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got th&#8217; official
vote!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Garwood, taking his papers from the table,
went out and said to the reporters:</p>

<p>&#8220;Conventions have been held in all the senatorial
districts down the state, and sixty-nine candidates
are already nominated. Of these sixty-nine, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
have beyond any question&#8221;&mdash;he consulted his paper,
as if to make sure of the number&mdash;&#8220;we have fifty-three,
and that doesn&#8217;t include the nine hold-over
senators who are with us. We can lose ten of them
at the polls and still have enough to control the
caucus. In Cook County, to-morrow, we&#8217;ll carry
the First, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Eleventh,
Seventeenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-first, Twenty-third
and the country towns&mdash;the Seventh&mdash;giving
us thirty-five more candidates, or ninety-seven in
all. This is a conservative estimate, and gives the
doubtful districts to Warren. We can lose Cook to-morrow
and still have a fighting chance to win out.
I regard the battle as ours. Senator Warren is defeated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over at the Richelieu,&#8221; said Cowley, of the
<i>News-Despatch</i>, &#8220;Baldwin claims they have you
whipped to a standstill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re welcome over there to any comfort they
can get out of the situation,&#8221; said Garwood in a
superior way.</p>

<p>It rained on the day of the primaries. All morning
politicians, big and little, stamped into Senator
Warren&#8217;s hotel on Michigan Avenue, or stamped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
into the Grand, tracking with greasy mud the muslin
that had been stretched over the carpet in Colonel
Talbott&#8217;s headquarters. The polls were to open at
one o&#8217;clock. The colonel had risen early, after three
hours&#8217; sleep, and snatched his breakfast from a tray,
talking to Carroll between bites. All morning he
was buttonholed by men who scuffled for a word,
complaining that Warren&#8217;s fellows would have
money to burn, and he fought with them, bill by bill,
for the few dollars he had in his pocket. He was
only liberal, to the extent that his slender campaign
funds permitted liberality, with those who were to
work in Carroll&#8217;s district. As the day wore on and
he received reports and despatched orders, like a
general fighting a battle, the colonel&#8217;s spirits rose,
and the politicians, when he ordered them sharply
about, paused at the door to look back at him, pleased
by the thought that this was the Colonel Talbott of
the good old days.</p>

<p>It was a wicked battle they fought out at the polls
that day. The Warren men had control of the party
organization and named the judges and clerks. Inmates
of lodging houses, and Lake Front hoboes,
their rags steaming in the warm rain, were hauled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
from poll to poll in big moving vans, and voted
wherever Warren needed votes and as often as he
pleased. The city hall took a hand and furnished
policemen in larger numbers than the primary election
law intended, so that whenever an anti-Warren
challenger challenged a vote he was hustled by officers,
and if he resisted, bundled off to the Harrison
Street police station and locked up on a charge of
disturbance. Late in the afternoon reports coming
from Halsted Street that the Fifth Ward was in
danger, the colonel escaped from his headquarters
and went into the trenches himself. Carroll never
forgot the old man as he splashed from poll to poll
that waning summer day, or stood in the drenching
rain before a voting booth, waving back policemen,
ordering men up to vote, threatening judges and
clerks. He had never heard the old man swear before.</p>

<p>At seven o&#8217;clock the polls closed. Warren carried
some of the districts, the opposition others. Both
claimed the victory. It was left for the convention
to decide.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The colonel, for some reason, preferred not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
get up the next morning, but opened his mail, read
his papers, ate his breakfast, and finally held his
morning levee, the last of the campaign, in bed. The
politicians who had been waiting outside for an
hour, grumbled at such indolence, and, when they
were finally admitted to their leader&#8217;s presence, suspected
him of imitating the undemocratic luxuriousness
of Senator Warren, who received his callers in
bed every morning. But by nine o&#8217;clock they had
received their final instructions and scattered to the
conventions, and when Mosely and Garwood sauntered
in from the breakfast-room, they found only
a few stragglers, who lingered on in the hope of beer
money, at least, for their imaginary services on this
decisive day. Malachi Nolan, in black garments
and white cravat, came presently, his big diamond
flashing, his face shining and red from his dull
razor, and then Carroll, at the sound of whose
young step and fresh laugh the colonel succeeded in
evoking a wan, tired smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just lazy, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; he declared reassuringly,
seeing Carroll halt in surprise. He reared himself
on his elbow, and as he raised his head, its white
hair all tangled, Carroll saw how haggard he was.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
He never had seen him look so old, so white, so
worn, before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was waiting for you,&#8221; said the colonel, indicating
Nolan with a finger that was like a claw. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
fixed everything but the First District.&#8221; He paused
for breath. &#8220;The First Ward&#8217;s solid, isn&#8217;t it? Well,
all right. But watch Donahue. I&#8217;m sorry we ever
let him get on the delegation. And then, let&#8217;s see&#8221;&mdash;he
pressed his brow in a troubled effort to steady his
senses&mdash;&#8220;oh, yes. See McGlynn and have him lay
down on Hardy, and tell Reinhold that if he wants
that job from the South Park board he&#8217;d better get
in line, and as to Wright&mdash;his brother&#8217;s a conductor
on the Cottage Grove line, and you can get at him
through Harlow. Tell him I sent you. That&#8217;ll give
you thirty-five votes on the first ballot, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Carroll, who had turned to reply to some jest of
Mosely&#8217;s, heard a groan. Instantly he looked back
at the colonel. The old politician, his face livid,
was struggling as if he wished to get out of bed.
He writhed a moment, then his head nodded, his
chin dropped to his breast, and he collapsed in a
heap, among the tumbled bedclothes. Carroll paled
with a sudden sickness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>&#8220;He&#8217;s fainted,&#8221; said Garwood, fumbling at the
throat of the colonel&#8217;s shirt. Malachi Nolan brought
a cup of water, Mosely hunted impatiently for a
flask of whisky, and when they had straightened him
out upon his pillows, Carroll ran for the hotel physician.
The colonel recovered consciousness before
the physician came and glanced around with an
expression of embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn such a heart, anyway,&#8221; he said. Then
young Doctor Lambert came with his new stethoscope.
When the doctor had finished his auscultation,
the colonel said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Malachi, vote your delegation solid every time&mdash;don&#8217;t
give complimentary votes&mdash;it&#8217;s dangerous.
And remember&mdash;I don&#8217;t care what happens so long
as Carroll&#8217;s nominated, trade anything, everything
for that, and send me word&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But they hushed him.</p>

<p>At noon Doctor Foerder, the specialist, arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Lambert,&#8221; he said, scowling about him as
he put down his tremendous leather valise, big with
the mysterious contrivances of modern surgery,
pulled off his gloves, and with his quick, professional
tread, stepped to the bedside. He exposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
the colonel&#8217;s big chest, and began a delicate percussion
with his white fingers. When he had done tapping,
he laid his ear over the colonel&#8217;s heart, and
listened silently a long time to the cardiac murmurs,
he rolled under his fingers the superficial vessels of
the temples, the forearms, the wrists, the knees, he
counted the pulse; and he looked long at the old
man&#8217;s finger-nails. When he paused, the colonel said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Foerder had retreated from the bedside
and was writing his directions precisely, logically, as
an official draws up a report, beginning each paragraph
with a Roman numeral. He did not answer
the colonel.</p>

<p>Foerder briefly consulted with Lambert, that is,
repeated the directions he had already written out,
and began to buckle his big valise.</p>

<p>&#8220;And as to a nurse?&#8221; asked Doctor Lambert.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send one of my own,&#8221; said Foerder, hastily
lighting a Russian cigarette. He could not remain
long in one place. He had patients to see and a
lecture to deliver over at Rush Medical College and
his man was waiting with his high-hooded phaeton
down in Jackson Boulevard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>The nurse, diffusing a faint odor of antiseptics,
came from Doctor Foerder&#8217;s private hospital, laid
aside her bonnet and veil and pausing an instant to
give a woman&#8217;s touch to her hair, quietly and deftly
set the room in order.</p>

<p>All that afternoon the colonel lay in his darkened
bedroom, fighting the battle of his life. He lay so
still that the nurse almost fancied him asleep, so
regular was his breathing. Once he broke the silence
by asking the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty minutes after three,&#8221; the nurse responded,
glancing at her little watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the conventions, then,&#8221; the colonel said,
&#8220;are over. I wonder why they don&#8217;t send me word.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse did not notice his speech, and he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, you doubtless are not interested in
politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>The talking brought on a spasm of dyspn&#339;a, and
the colonel struggled so painfully for his breath
that the nurse had to prop him up with pillows in a
sitting posture, as those who are afflicted with
asthma pass their nights, finding it easier thus to
breathe. The colonel begged the nurse&#8217;s pardon, as
if he had committed some indelicacy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>About this time news was brought from the Fifth
District convention in Arlington Hall and from the
Sixth in Jung&#8217;s Hall, that the Warren men had
carried both districts. The colonel, hearing the
hoarse whispering between the messengers and
Mosely in the room outside, demanded information,
and Doctor Lambert had to tell him. The colonel
wished to see Mosely, he had some new plan for the
West Side to offset their loss; and he saw Mosely
and the plan was put in execution. Then the colonel
seemed once more to sleep. When he opened his
eyes he asked if he could not have a cigar&mdash;&#8220;seegar,&#8221;
he pronounced it&mdash;assuring the nurse that he felt
much better, but she said, as one might say to the
whim of a child to whom explanations are not vouchsafed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>And there was silence again, and the ticking of
the nurse&#8217;s little watch.</p>

<p>By four o&#8217;clock the colonel became restless once
more, and asked if there were any news. When the
nurse said no, he insisted that there must be some
message, some letter, some telegram. He did not
know that his followers, vindicating all history, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
now standing afar off. He worried and grew incoherent.
He seemed to confuse Carroll with the boy
who was sleeping under the stars far away in
Arizona.</p>

<p>Doctor Foerder returned at four o&#8217;clock. He had
not been expected before evening, but he was interested
in the case. He had mentioned it in his lecture
that day. He had commented on the wonderful
display of vitality on the patient&#8217;s part, and spoken
of the value in such cases of moral treatment, of
encouraging words and a confident manner. He
read the nurse&#8217;s chart, counted the colonel&#8217;s pulse
for fifteen seconds and calculated the rate by multiplication,
drew down the old man&#8217;s eyelids, noting
the senile arc that was whitening the periphery of
the cornea, and he examined the finger-nails; then
the percussion and the auscultation. When he raised
his black head, the colonel said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Any news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re doing well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw!&#8221; said the colonel impatiently, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
mean that&mdash;any news from the conventions?&#8221;</p>

<p>Foerder hesitated, as if half reluctant to display
interest in anything so human, but said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said the colonel eagerly, his eyes brightening
with a light that alarmed the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say you&#8217;ve carried some districts on the
North Side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which ones?&#8221; asked the colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they say Warner has carried some North
Side districts, too&mdash;and some West Side districts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Warner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, whatever his name is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Foerder was silent, and the colonel lay a
long time thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you learn how it&#8217;s going in the Ninth, or
the Second, or the Seventeenth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say it&#8217;s about an even break everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how&#8217;s the First?&#8221; The colonel put this
question in a whisper, as if he feared the answer.
The doctor did not know. Then the silence again,
and the colonel&#8217;s labored breathing, and the ticking
of the nurse&#8217;s little gold watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;What district do you live in, Doctor?&#8221; the colonel
asked later.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>&#8220;I?&#8221; replied the medical man in some surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;why, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The colonel faintly smiled. &#8220;Where do you live,
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Drexel Boulevard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the Fifth,&#8221; the colonel said. &#8220;Warren
carried that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he?&#8221; The doctor looked as if he were
ashamed. &#8220;We mustn&#8217;t talk any more just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Foerder remained until evening, pacing the anteroom,
his hands behind him, his lips twitching in his
involuntary smile. Now and then he took a turn in
the long, dark, softly carpeted hall, to smoke a cigarette.
At times some politician would come with
a scared face and inquire about the colonel, and the
doctor always demanded news of the battle, before
he answered the questions. The reports brought by
the politicians were not encouraging, and they hurried
outside again. Their visits, as the afternoon
waned, became fewer. Even Mosely and Garwood
had been glad of the exciting excuse offered by the
First District convention in Italia Hall down Clark
Street to escape from the shadowed headquarters.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
At six o&#8217;clock no one had been there for an hour,
save some sympathetic bell-boys and porters from
down-stairs, and Carroll, of course&mdash;he came every
half-hour from the convention, disheveled, bathed in
perspiration, his eyes burning with excitement and
suspense. Foerder would not allow him to see the
colonel, who lay behind the white door, his eyes
half closed, too weak any longer to whisper.</p>

<p>At seven o&#8217;clock the reporters came, and Doctor
Foerder, as they put it, issued a bulletin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s alive,&#8221; the doctor said, &#8220;pulse 120 to 124,
respiration 22 to 26, temperature 98. His remarkable
nerve alone sustains him. He&#8217;s making the
most magnificent fight I ever saw in all my life&mdash;have
you heard anything from the convention?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all over but the one in the First District,&#8221;
one of the reporters said, while they scribbled down
the physician&#8217;s figures. &#8220;It all depends now upon
what that does. It&#8217;s the worst fight ever known in
Chicago. They say Warren has spent twenty-five
thousand to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it look as if he could be elected there&mdash;in
the First, you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>The reporters smiled and winked one at another.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>The colonel lay like one asleep, until far along in
the evening. Once or twice he opened his eyes and
looked an inquiry into the doctor&#8217;s eyes, but Foerder
could only shake his head. And once or twice he
muttered something about Baldwin, and was troubled
that they could not understand. Then he sank
into a state of coma, and the news for which all
were waiting would not come.</p>

<p>Doctor Foerder was for ever glancing at his
watch and asking Lambert how he thought the First
District convention would turn out. Lambert had
no idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we&#8217;ll win,&#8221; Foerder would say. Finally
he sent Lambert down for news. Lambert hurried
back. They had taken forty-six ballots, he said,
and the vote was tied. At ten o&#8217;clock Doctor Foerder
examined the colonel again, examined his eyes, his
finger-nails, drummed on his chest, listened to his
heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re magnificent!&#8221; he could not refrain from
whispering, but his patient did not answer or look,
or even smile this time. He was growing very weak.
His breathing was faint, he inhaled the air through
livid lips. He did not arouse from his stupor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>Doctor Foerder got very impatient. &#8220;We can&#8217;t
wait much longer,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all we can do, now,&#8221; said Lambert.</p>

<p>Foerder went outside. The anteroom was deserted.
The politicians came no more. He would
sit down, then instantly get up, walk back and forth;
his eyebrows knitting in his scowl, his lips twitching
in that mirthless smile. And he smoked cigarette
after cigarette. He did this for an hour.</p>

<p>Along toward midnight he heard a step. Flying
to the door, he saw Carroll, dragging down the hall
with the step of defeat and exhaustion. The boy&#8217;s
hair was matted under his hat, his eyes were dull,
sunken, black as night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Licked,&#8221; he said, waving his hands with a gesture
of despair, as if the world had come to an end.
Foerder went inside, leaving Carroll to sink into the
first chair. But a moment later the physician opened
the white door, and beckoned with his head. The
motion was conclusive, final. He held the door ajar,
and Carroll entered. The useless drugs had been
pushed aside. The room was filled with the strange
silence, the odor of death. Lambert stood at the
window, looking out into the darkness. The nurse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
stood by the bed, waiting to perform her last office
for the dying man.</p>

<p>Carroll timidly approached and looked down at
the long form, scarcely outlined by the sheet, at
the rigid head, at the great, waxen brow, at the
little blue spheres formed by the closed eyelids, at
the mouth slightly open beneath the white mustache
with its tinge of yellow. Doctor Foerder was pressing
his fingers to the colonel&#8217;s wrist. The breathing
had lost all human quality, it was but a series of
automatic gasps, which, it seemed, would never end.
Finally they grew shorter, at last they ceased, there
was one faint inspiration, and Doctor Foerder, laying
the thin old hand down upon the colonel&#8217;s breast,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence for a whole minute. Then
Doctor Lambert tossed up the window, and Carroll
heard, in the street below, a crowd shuffling over the
sidewalk, a crowd coming, as he knew, from the
convention in Italia Hall. And suddenly from the
crowd arose a raucous, drunken yell:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for Warren!&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">REFORM IN THE FIRST</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE senatorial convention in the First District
was to convene at ten o&#8217;clock, in a dingy little
hall in lower Clark Street, lighted by windows so
long unwashed that they looked like ground glass.
From the chandeliers, black and sticky with dead
flies, shreds of tissue paper fluttered, relics of some
boisterous f&ecirc;te an Italian society had given there
long ago. The floor was damp in arabesque wrought
by a sprinkling-can, for the janitor had sprayed
water there to lay the dust he was too indifferent to
remove. Perhaps a hundred chairs were set in amphitheatrical
order, and before them stood a kitchen
table, on which was a white water pitcher, flanked
by a glass, thickened by various sedimentary deposits
within.</p>

<p>In the saloon below, at nine o&#8217;clock, scores of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
delegates were already shuffling in the sawdust that
covered the floor, holding huge schooners of beer
in their hairy fists, gorging grossly at the free lunch
table, with bologna, rank onions and rye bread. The
foam of the beer clung to their mustaches, which,
after each sip, they sucked between their lips. Most
of them managed, at the same time they were eating
and drinking, by a dexterous sleight-of-hand, to
smoke cheap domestic cigars, and a cloud of white
smoke rolled along the low ceiling. Each new arrival
was greeted with some obscene but endearing epithet,
and the room rang with laughter and profanity.
A keg of beer had been provided by one of Conway&#8217;s
managers, and the bartender, wiping his hands on
a dirty towel, was rid, so long as the keg lasted, of
the responsibility of keeping account of drinks, and
of ringing up the change on the cash register. At
eleven o&#8217;clock the keg was empty, the free lunch
table abandoned to the flies, and the delegates scuffled
up the dingy stairs to the hall. Half an hour later
the chairman of the senatorial district committee
pounded the kitchen table with a leg of a broken
chair, and shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;The convention will be in order.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>This declaration made no impression upon the
babel of voices, the laughter, the profanity, the
noise of shuffling feet and scraping chairs. The
delegates were scrambling to their places, seating
themselves by wards. Reporters flung themselves
into seats at a second table and gazed about the
room, noting who were there. The political men of
the morning papers did not trouble themselves to
take seats. They loafed among the politicians in
a way superior to the reporters for the afternoon
papers, as if they were politicians themselves, making
history instead of recording it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the noise did not abate, and the committeeman
was growing red in the face. The morning
was warm, and the room, already cloudy with
tobacco smoke, was filling with a noisome human
odor. The atmosphere was feculent. Delegates
removed their coats, hanging them over the backs
of their chairs. Finally the chairman of the committee,
growing impatient, split the table with his
club and yelled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn it all, boys, come to order!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, eager to resign such a difficult command,
he hastened to announce:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>&#8220;The committee has named Honorable John P.
Muldoon to act as temp&#8217;ry chairman.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed the chair leg to John P. Muldoon,
who, stroking back his curly hair from his brow,
began to beat the table impartially.</p>

<p>All this while Underwood stood against the wall,
looking on. The question that had been agitating
him for weeks was about to be decided, but now that
the ordeal was actually upon him, the consciousness
beat numbly against his brain, so that the whole
scene lacked reality, almost interest. He was dazed.
He was about to take his baptism of political fire,
and he trembled like a white novitiate.</p>

<p>Underwood belonged to one of the oldest families
of Chicago&mdash;the name had been known there before
the fire. His father, who had lately taken him into
his law firm, continued to cling in his conservatism
to an old stone house in Michigan Avenue long
after his neighbors had abandoned their mansions
to uncertain boarders, and either retreated farther
south or advanced to the North Side. John Underwood
had come out of Harvard with a young lawyer&#8217;s
ambition in politics, an ambition that had the
United States senate merely as a beginning of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
home stretch, and when the year rolled around in
which state senators were to be elected in the odd
numbered districts he decided that it was time to
begin.</p>

<p>The newspapers had scented the sensation that
lurked in the candidature of a young man like
Underwood in a district like the First, and because
he was rich, because he wore good clothes, because
he went into what is called society, promptly dubbed
him a reformer, and thus weighted he had set out
upon his race for the nomination. He liked to see
his name in the newspapers, liked to think of himself
as a reformer, though he was embarrassed in
this attitude by the fascinating figure of the political
boss he had hoped to become&mdash;a well-dressed, gentlemanly
boss, of course, who, while at home in those
saloons where he permitted the convivial familiarity
of the boys, nevertheless took his luncheons at his
club. He fell into a way of speaking of the First as
&#8220;my district,&#8221; spoke of it, in fact, as if he, instead
of Malachi Nolan and &#8220;Cinch&#8221; Conway, owned it,
and when certain ward politicians in the first days
of the campaign called upon him, Underwood was
pleased to lend them money, just as he was pleased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
to comply with the requests of certain others who
organized the John W. Underwood First Ward
Campaign Club, and sent a committee to inform him
that they were assembled in the club rooms ready to
transact business, and beer only four dollars a keg.
He winked confidentially at himself in the mirror
that night as he gave a final touch to his white cravat
and surveyed his fine young form arrayed in evening
clothes for the reform banquet at the Palmer
House. His speech was <i>The Tendencies of Modern
Politics</i>. The newspapers said it was a very brilliant
speech, breathing lofty political sentiments that
were bound to make John W. Underwood votes.
Also, the Reform Club indorsed his candidature.</p>

<p>As Underwood leaned against the greasy wall of
the little hall on lower Clark Street this morning,
the whole campaign flashed before him, just as the
events of a lifetime are said in books to flash before
the mind of a drowning man. He recalled every
vivid detail of the call Baldwin had made upon him,
how he entered his private office without troubling
the pale, pimpled office boy to announce him, how
he lifted from his carefully parted hair his straw hat
with its youthful band of blue, and laughed out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
&#8220;John, my boy, how are you? Hot, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; He
could see Baldwin as he sat in the solid oak chair
that stood intimately beside his roll-top desk,
fanning his ruddy face with the hat, which had
impressed a broad red band on his forehead. Underwood
had been glad enough to close <i>Cooley on Taxation</i>
and revolve his chair to face Baldwin, just
as if he had been a client, for Baldwin was the most
important politician who had ever called upon him
professionally.</p>

<p>Underwood remembered clearly how Baldwin&#8217;s
excellent teeth glistened when he smiled, how he
lighted a Turkish cigarette and, tilting up his chin,
blew a long, airy stream of blue smoke through the
thick hairs of his mustache. He could even remember
how carefully Baldwin sheltered the flame of the
match for Underwood&#8217;s cigarette, in that curious
spirit of economy men always practice with regard
to matches, much as if there were only one match
left in the whole world. And then he could recall
almost word for word their conversation. Baldwin
had frankly told him that Conway had him
handicapped, because he had the city hall with him
and controlled the Fifth Ward. Simmons, Baldwin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
had said, didn&#8217;t cut much ice; he had some labor
leaders with him, and would get a bunch of delegates
from his own ward, but that was about all. In
fact, said Baldwin, concluding his judicial summing
up, Conway could win out, hands down, if it were
not for his recent quarrel with Malachi Nolan. Underwood
remembered that during all this frankness
he had reflectively drawn rude little geometrical
figures on an envelope and had been somehow afraid
to look up at Baldwin, for the noted lobbyist had
sat there transfixing him with an eye that could read
the mind of a man when it was impinged on politics&mdash;that
is, practical politics&mdash;as easily as it could a
poker hand across a table stacked with blue chips.</p>

<p>He knew Baldwin had come with some practical
proposition, and when the lobbyist suggested that he
was too respectable, and would run better in some
residence district, that the boys looked upon him as
a reformer, and that the silk stockings were not
practical enough to help him, Underwood had felt
that at last it was coming. It was simple enough.
Baldwin had been talking that very morning about
Underwood&#8217;s candidature to Mr. Weed of the
Metropolitan Motor System, and to Mr. Peabody,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
president of the Gas Company, and they had been
very much interested. They had an anxiety to see
good men nominated that year, for they had large
business interests that were more or less affected by
legislation, and had feared they would have to settle
on Conway. Conway had experience in legislative
matters, and had been friendly enough in the city
council, yet they felt they could hardly trust him&mdash;he
was such a grafter, and in such things, Baldwin
blandly assured Underwood, they had to depend
upon a man&#8217;s honor alone, and so they had sent
Baldwin to suggest that Underwood meet them at
luncheon, and talk matters over. Baldwin, with his
love of ease and luxury, had preferred a dinner
over at the Cardinal&#8217;s in the evening, but Mr. Peabody
had something on hand with the trustees of his
church and couldn&#8217;t meet them then. Baldwin had
taken out his watch at this point, with the air of a
man who suddenly remembers some important engagement&mdash;the
details all came back with a fidelity
that was painful&mdash;and stood awaiting Underwood&#8217;s
reply, with the open watch ticking impatiently in his
palm.</p>

<p>Of course, Underwood had understood&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
he wished ardently to be nominated and elected.
He could see himself swinging idly in a big chair
behind a walnut desk in the senate chamber, just as
an actor sees himself, with an artist&#8217;s ecstatic, half-frightened
gasp, in some new part he is about to
study. The position would give him much importance,
he would be riding back and forth between
Chicago and Springfield on a pass, it would be so
pleasant to be addressed as senator, to be consulted,
to head delegations in state conventions and cast
the solid vote for any one he pleased; besides, it
would be a good training for Washington, he could
practise in oratory and parliamentary law just as
he practised on friendless paupers over in the criminal
court when his father influenced some judge to
appoint him to defend an indigent prisoner. It
meant only one little word, he could be wary of
promises. His heart had expanded, he had turned
half around in his chair to face Baldwin, when
suddenly the reformer within him rose to object,
pointed to his ideals, rehearsed the speech on <i>The
Tendencies of Modern Politics</i>, recalled all the
good words the independent papers had spoken of
him, urged the beauty of great sacrifices for principle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
At the idea of self-sacrifice, Underwood had
felt a melting self-pity, he admired himself in this
new r&ocirc;le of a self-sacrificing reformer. And so he
flung the cigarette out of the window, watched it
whirl down to the melting tar of the roofs below and
said firmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have an engagement this morning, Mr. Baldwin.
I&#8217;m sorry, but I guess I can&#8217;t come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Underwood saw the pleasantness leave
Baldwin&#8217;s face, saw him fleck a flake of ash from the
white waistcoat he wore with his summer suit of
blue, and snapping the lid of his watch shut, he once
more heard him say in a final and reproachful tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all right; sorry, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Underwood wondered that morning in the noisy
convention hall, whether, if he had the decision to
make over again, he would decline such influence. It
had been the cause of much doubt and some regret
at the time. The boss within him had protested&mdash;surely
it was a political mistake&mdash;and the boss was
louder than the reformer, and more plausible. He
came forward with a brilliant scheme. He recalled
Baldwin&#8217;s reference to the rivalry between Nolan
and Conway. Underwood remembered that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
he suggested the possibility of Nolan&#8217;s running for
the nomination himself, Baldwin had shaken his
head&mdash;there wasn&#8217;t enough in it, he said. Nolan
could do very much better in the council, where he
was. Besides, Mr. Weed and Mr. Peabody disliked
him.</p>

<p>Underwood thought out his scheme that afternoon,
while hunting in the digest for cases in point
to be cited in a case his father was preparing for
the appellate court. The work of looking up cases
in point, while its results are impressive and seem
to smell of the lamp, had in reality grown quite
automatic to Underwood, and as he loafed over digests
and reports and jotted down his notes, he elaborated
the scheme, just what he would say and do,
how he would appear, and so forth. And so, when
he entered Malachi Nolan&#8217;s place in Dearborn
Street, early that evening, he was fully prepared.
The details of this incident came back just as the details
of Baldwin&#8217;s visit had done&mdash;the empty saloon,
the alderman himself leaning over his bar, his white
apron rolled into a big girth about his middle, the
cigar in the round hole at the corner of his mouth
gone out, denoting that it was time for him to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
down the alley to Billy Boyle&#8217;s and get his porterhouse
and baked potato.</p>

<p>Underwood watched Malachi Nolan mix his
Martini cocktail, splash it picturesquely into a
sparkling glass and bejewel it with a Maraschino
cherry, then gravely take a cigar for himself and
stow it away in his ample waistcoat. Then, as Nolan
mopped the bar with professional sweep of his
white-sleeved, muscular arm, Underwood unfolded
his brilliant scheme, skirting carefully the acute suspicions
of an old politician. But Nolan mopped,
blinking inscrutably, at last putting the damp cloth
away in some mysterious place under the counter.
The fat Maltese cat, waiting until the moisture on
the bar had evaporated, stretched herself again beside
the silver urn that held the crackers and the little
cubes of cheese. Still Nolan blinked in silence, like a
hostile jury with its mind made up, until at last, in
desperation, Underwood blurted out his proposition.
Nolan blinked some more, then, half opening his
blue Irish eyes, grunted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I like your gall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Underwood&#8217;s spirits fell, yet he was not disappointed.
It was, after all, just what he had expected.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
It served him right for his presumption, if nothing
more&mdash;though the subdued reformer within had
hinted at other reasons. He hung his head, twirling
his empty glass disconsolately. He did not see the
light that twinkled in the blue eyes, he had not then
known how very ready Nolan was to form any combination
that would beat Conway and Baldwin, especially
with a reformer like himself who had money
to spend on his ambitions. He had not discerned
how badly the man whom the newspapers always
cartooned with the First Ward sticking out of his
vest pocket, needed a reformer in his business, as
the saying is. Hence his glad surprise when Nolan
wiped his big hand on his apron like a washer-woman
and held it out, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m wit&#8217; ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the campaign, under Nolan&#8217;s management,
in the most wonderful legislative district&mdash;a cosmopolitan
district, bristling with sociological problems,
a district that has fewer homes and more saloons,
more commerce and more sloth, more millionaires
and more paupers, and while it confines within its
boundaries the skyscrapers, clubs, theaters and hundred
churches of a metropolis, still boasts a police<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
station with more arrests on its blotter than any
other in the world. Night after night, with Nolan&#8217;s
two candidates for the house, he spent in saloons
where a candidate must treat and distribute his cards
that the boys may size him up; lodging houses and
barrel houses in lower Clark Street, where sweating
negroes and frowsy whites drank five-cent whisky
with him; blazing saloons along the levee, where
even the poor, painted girls at the tables lifted their
glasses when he ordered the drinks for the house;
crap games and policy shops in lower Clark Street,
the Syrian, Arabic, Chinese and Italian quarters
down by the squalid Bad Lands, and at last a happier
evening along the Archey Road. Underwood
had three weeks of this, and as he stood in the convention
hall that morning, unwashed, unshaven, his
linen soiled, his shoes muddy, his own friends would
not have known him, though he cared little enough
for this now&mdash;they had all forgotten to go to the
primaries the day before, and those for whom he
had sent carriages had been too busy, or too respectable,
to respond. The taste of bad beer and the
scorch of cheap cigars still smacked in his mouth&mdash;indeed,
he did not get them entirely out until he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
came back from Mt. Clemens two weeks after the
nomination.</p>

<p>But they were balloting for permanent chairman
now. It would be a test vote; it would disclose his
own strength and the strength of Conway. He
looked over the red faces before him. He saw Conway
himself moving among the delegates, snarling,
cursing, quarreling with the friends of years; he
saw Conway&#8217;s candidate for the house, McGlone,
over in the Second Ward delegation, his coat off, a
handkerchief about his fat neck, a fuming cigar between
his chubby fingers, turning on his heavy
haunches to revile some man who was numbered
with Nolan&#8217;s crowd; he saw in the First Ward delegation,
Malachi Nolan, clean-shaven, in black coat
and cravat, his iron gray hair cropped short, calm
alone of all the others. He would have looked the
priest more than the saloon-keeper, had he smoked
his cigar differently. Now and then he solemnly
raised his hand, with almost the benediction of a
father, to still the clamor of his delegation, which,
with its twenty-one votes, was safe at all events for
Underwood.</p>

<p>Muldoon was Conway&#8217;s man&mdash;they would try to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
make the temporary organization permanent. D&#8217;Ormand
was Underwood&#8217;s candidate. And Muldoon
won. Underwood had lost the first round.</p>

<p>The candidates for senator were to be placed in
nomination first. Underwood stood in the crowded
doorway and heard Conway&#8217;s name presented.
Then, in the cheering, with his heart in his sanded
throat, he heard the chairman say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any other nominations?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a momentary stillness, and then he
heard a thick, strong voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Misther Chairman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentleman from the First Ward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Misther Chairman,&#8221; the thick, strong voice said,
&#8220;I roise to place in nomynation the name of wan&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the voice of Malachi Nolan, and Underwood
suddenly remembered that Nolan was to place
his name before the convention. He listened an
instant, but could not endure it long. He could not
endure that men should see him in the hour when
his name was being thus laid naked to the world.
Reporters were writing it down, perhaps the crowd
would laugh or whistle or hiss. Besides, candidates
do not remain in the convention hall; they await the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
committee of notification in some near-by saloon.
He squeezed through the mass of men who stood on
tiptoes, stretching their necks to see and hear the old
leader of the First Ward, and fled.</p>

<p>The first ballot was taken&mdash;Conway, 31; Underwood,
30; Simmons, the dark horse, 8; necessary
to a choice, 35. The vote was unchanged for
twenty-six ballots, till the afternoon had worn away,
and the trucks had jolted off the cobblestones of
Clark Street, till the lights were flaring and hot
tamale men, gamblers, beggars, street walkers, all
the denizens of darkness were shifting along the
sidewalks, till the policemen had been changed on
their beats, and Pinkerton night watchmen were
trying the doors of stores, till Chinamen shuffled
forth, and Jewesses and Italian women emerged for
their evening breath of air, bringing swart and
grimy children to play upon the heated flags. The
hall was lighted, just as if some Italian festival were
to be held there. The reporters&#8217; places at the table
were taken by the men who did politics for the
morning papers, themselves reduced at last to the
necessity of taking notes. They brought reports of
the results in other senatorial conventions held about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
town that day&mdash;it seemed to be assured that John
Skelley had carried the country towns, Lemont,
Riverside, Evanston, and so on. In certain west side
districts this man had won, in certain north side districts
that man had been successful. It looked as if
the old gang was going to break back into the legislature.</p>

<p>And so the interest in this one remaining
convention deepened, the strain tightened, the crowd
thickened. The delegates, tired and sullen, shed
their waistcoats, tore off their moist and dirty collars
and settled down to an angry fight. The amphitheatrical
arrangement of the chairs had long been
broken. The ward delegations now formed circles
about their leaders. The damp arabesques wrought
by the janitor&#8217;s superficial sprinkling-can had long
since been superseded by arabesques of tobacco
juice. The floor was littered with scraps of paper,
the spent ballots with which the stubborn contest had
been waged. The First Ward delegation was in a
solid ring, and in the center of it sat Malachi Nolan,
his elbows on his knees, tearing old ballots into tiny
specks of paper and strewing them on the floor, but
keeping all the while a surveying eye on the Fifth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Ward delegation, now divided into two groups, one
of which surrounded Howe, the other huddling
about Grogan, the lawyer, who, with disheveled hair,
a handkerchief about his neck, stood glaring angrily
at Nolan, his eyes shadowed by heavy circles telling
of weariness and the strain.</p>

<p>Now and then the leaders made desperate attempts
to trade, harrying Simmons, offering him
everything for his seven votes. Simmons himself, in
his turn, tried to induce each faction to swing its
strength to him.</p>

<p>But the situation remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Once Nolan sent for Underwood and whispered
to him. He thought he knew one or two Conway
men who could be got very cheaply, but the boy
shook his head&mdash;the reformer within him demurred&mdash;and
yet he smiled sardonically at the reformer
thinking of the primaries and the convention itself.</p>

<p>Then Malachi Nolan caught the chairman&#8217;s shifty
eye and moved an adjournment until morning. But
even as he spoke, Grogan scowled at Muldoon,
shook his head at his followers, and the room rang
with their hoarse shouts:</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no! no!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>Heartened by this confession of weakness on Nolan&#8217;s
part, they kept on yelling lustily:</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no! no!&#8221;</p>

<p>They even laughed, and Muldoon smote the table,
to declare the motion lost.</p>

<p>On the forty-seventh ballot, one of the Simmons
votes went over to Conway, and there was a faint
cheer. On the forty-eighth, one of the Simmons
votes went to Underwood, and parity was restored.
On the forty-ninth, Underwood gained another of
Simmons&#8217; votes&mdash;Nolan, it seemed, had promised to
get him on the janitor&#8217;s pay-roll in the state house&mdash;and
the vote was tied. This ballot stood:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class="tdc"> First </td><td class="tdc"> Second  </td><td class="tdc"> Fifth  </td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class="tdc">Ward</td><td class="tdc">Ward</td><td class="tdc">Ward</td><td class="tdc">  Total  </td></tr>

<tr><td>Conway</td><td class="tdr"> &mdash;</td><td class="tdr"> 10 &nbsp;</td><td class="tdr"> 22</td><td class="tdr"> 32</td></tr>
<tr><td>Underwood</td><td class="tdr"> 21</td><td class="tdr"> 4 &nbsp;</td><td class="tdr"> 7</td><td class="tdr"> 32</td></tr>
<tr><td>Simmons</td><td class="tdr"> &mdash;</td><td class="tdr"> 5 &nbsp;</td><td class="tdr"> &mdash;</td><td class="tdr"> 5</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The Simmons men were holding out, waiting to
throw their strength to the winner. When the
sixty-seventh ballot had been taken, Muldoon,
squinting in the miserable light, at the secretary&#8217;s
figures, hit the table with the chair leg and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;On this ballot Conway receives 32, Underwood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
32, Simmons 5. There being no choice, you will
prepare your ballots for another vote.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then one of the Conway men from the Second
Ward left his place, and touched one of Nolan&#8217;s
fellows in the First Ward delegation&mdash;Donahue&mdash;on
the shoulder. Donahue started. The man whispered
in his ear, and returned to his delegation, keeping
his eye on Donahue. Underwood looked on
breathlessly. Nolan, revolving slowly, held his hat
for every vote&mdash;last of all for Donahue&#8217;s. The man
dropped his folded ballot into the hat and hung his
head. Nolan calmly picked the ballot out of the hat
and gave it back to Donahue, who looked up in affected
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble, Malachi?&#8221; he said as innocently
as he could. He was not much of an actor.</p>

<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t do,&#8221; Nolan said, giving the ballot
back to the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Malachi, honest to God it is!&#8221; protested
Donahue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thin I&#8217;ll just put this wan in for ye, heh?&#8221; said
Nolan, drawing another ballot from the pocket of
his huge waistcoat and poising it above the hat.</p>

<p>The crowd had pressed around the First Ward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
delegation. The convention had risen to its feet, craning
red necks, and out of the mass, Grogan cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, here, Malachi Nolan, none o&#8217; that now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nolan turned his rugged face toward him and
said simply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s runnin&#8217; this dillygation, you or me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;none o&#8217; your bulldozing&mdash;we won&#8217;t stand
it!&#8221; replied Grogan angrily, his blue eyes blazing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You get to hell out o&#8217; this.&#8221; And so saying,
Nolan dropped the ballot into the hat and turned to
face the chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you all voted?&#8221; inquired Muldoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;First Ward!&#8221; the secretary called.</p>

<p>Nolan squared his shoulders, not having looked
in his hat or counted the ballots there, and said
slowly and impressively:</p>

<p>&#8220;On behalf av the solid dillygation av the First
Ward, I cast twinty-wan votes for John W. Underwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Misther Chairman! Misther Chairman!&#8221; cried
Grogan, waving his hand in the air, &#8220;I challenge that
vote! I challenge that vote!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentleman from the Fifth Ward challenges
the vote&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>&#8220;Misther Chairman,&#8221; said Nolan, standing with
one heavy foot on his chair and leveling a forefinger
at Muldoon, &#8220;a point of order! The gintleman from
the Fifth Ward has no right to challenge the vote
av the First Ward&mdash;he&#8217;s not a mimber of the dillygation!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the First Ward be polled,&#8221; calmly ruled Muldoon.
Nolan took his foot from his chair and
stepped to Donahue&#8217;s side. Every man in the First
Ward delegation, as his name was called from the
credentials, cried &#8220;Underwood!&#8221; As the secretary
neared the name of Donahue, Nolan laid his hand
heavily on the fellow&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Donahue!&#8221; called the secretary.</p>

<p>The fellow squirmed under Nolan&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Donahue!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him bluff you!&#8221; cried some one from
the Fifth Ward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vote as you damn please, Jimmie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;T&#8217;row the boots into &#8217;im, Donnie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Soak him one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take your hands off him, Bull Nolan!&#8221;</p>

<p>So they bawled and Donahue wriggled. But the
hand of Nolan, like the hand of Douglas, was his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
own, and gripped fast. Grogan, his face red, his
eyes on fire, leaped from his place in his delegation,
and started across the chairs for Nolan. The big
saloon-keeper gave him a look out of his little eye.
His left shoulder dipped, his left fist tightened. Grogan
halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vote, Jimmie, me lad,&#8221; said Nolan, in a soft
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Underwood!&#8221; said Donahue, in a whisper. His
weak, pinched, hungry face turned appealingly
toward Grogan. His blear eyes were filmy with disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;He votes for John W. Underwood, Misther
Chairman,&#8221; said Nolan complacently. The vote
was unchanged. The chairman ordered another
ballot.</p>

<p>And then, all at once, as if a breath from a sanded
desert had been blown into the room, Underwood
was sensible of a change in the atmosphere. The air
was perhaps no hotter than it had been for hours at
the close of that stifling day, no bluer with tobacco
smoke, no heavier with the smell borne in from
Clark Street on hot night winds that had started
cool and fresh from the lake four blocks away, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
smell compounded of many smells, the smell ascending
from foul and dark cellars beneath the sidewalk,
the smell of stale beer, the ammoniac smell of filthy
pavements, mingled with the feculence of unclean
bodies that had sweated for hours in the vitiated
air of that low-ceilinged, crowded room. It had
a strange moral density that oppressed him, that
oppressed all, even the politicians, for they ceased
from cursing and from speech, and now sat sullen,
silent, suspiciously eying their companions. It was
an atmosphere charged with some ominous foreboding,
some awful fear. Underwood had never felt
that atmosphere before, yet, with a gasp that came
not as an effect of the heat, he recognized its meaning.</p>

<p>A hush fell. Muldoon, his black, curly locks shining
with perspiration, was leaning on his improvised
gavel, his keen eye, the Irish eye that so readily
seizes such situations, darting into every face before
him.</p>

<p>And suddenly came that for which they were
waiting. A man entered the hall and strode straight
across the floor into the Fifth Ward delegation, into
the group where the Underwood men were clustered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
about their leader. He wore evening clothes, his
black dinner-coat and white shirt bosom striking a
vivid note in the scene. He walked briskly, but his
mind was so intent upon his pose that it was not
until he had removed his cigarette from his lips and
had observed Underwood, that his white teeth
showed beneath his reddish mustache in the well-known
smile of George R. Baldwin. He elbowed
his way into the very midst of the Underwood men
from the Fifth Ward, and leading one of them
aside, talked with him an instant, and then returned
him, as it were, to his place in the delegation. Then
he brought forth another, whispered to him for an
earnest moment, and sent him back, with a smile and
a slap on the shoulder. The third delegate detained
him longer, and once, as he argued with him, the
slightest shade of displeasure crossed Baldwin&#8217;s
face, but in an instant the smile replaced it, and he
talked&mdash;convincingly, it seemed. Before Baldwin
returned this man to his delegation, he shook hands
with him.</p>

<p>The secretary was calling the wards, and Nolan
had announced the result in his delegation. The
Fifth Ward was a long while in preparing its ballots.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
There was trouble of some sort there, among
the Underwood men. Nolan was urging, expostulating,
cursing, commanding. The air was tense.
It seemed to Underwood that it must inevitably be
shattered by some moral cataclysm in the soul of
man. Grogan&#8217;s brow was knit, as he waited, hat in
hand. The delegates voted. Feverishly, with
trembling fingers, Grogan opened and counted the
bits of paper. Then he sprang to his feet, with a
wild, glad light in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Misther Chairman!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;the Fifth Ward
casts twenty-five votes for Conway and four for
Underwood!&#8221;</p>

<p>The three bolters in the Fifth Ward delegation
sat with defiance in their faces, but they could not
sustain the expression, even by huddling close together.
They broke for the door, wriggling their
way through masses of men, who made their passage
uncertain, almost perilous. A billow of applause
broke from the Conway men, and submerged
the convention. Delegates all over the hall were on
their feet, clamoring for recognition, but Malachi
Nolan&#8217;s voice boomed heavily above all other voices.
His fist was in the air above all other fists.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>&#8220;Misther Chairman!&#8221; he yelled, &#8220;I challenge that
vote!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Misther Chairman!&#8221; yelled Grogan, &#8220;a point of
order! The gentleman isn&#8217;t a member of the Fifth
Ward delegation and can not challenge its vote!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The point of order is well taken,&#8221; promptly ruled
the chair. &#8220;The gentleman from the First Ward is
out of order&mdash;he will take his seat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Men were screaming, brandishing fists, waving
hats, coats, anything, scraping chairs, pounding the
floor with them. There were heavy, brutal oaths,
and, here and there, the smack of a fist on a face.
In the tumult, the five Simmons votes went to Conway.
Muldoon was beating the table with his club
and crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Order! order! order!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To hell with order!&#8221; bawled some one from the
First Ward delegation.</p>

<p>&#8220;On this ballot,&#8221; Muldoon was calling, &#8220;there
were sixty-nine votes cast; necessary to a choice,
thirty-five. James P. Conway has received forty
votes; John W. Underwood, twenty-nine, and
George W. Simmons&#8221;&mdash;he paused, as if to decipher
the vote&mdash;&#8220;none. James P. Conway, having received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
the necessary number of votes, is therefore
declared the nominee of this convention.&#8221;</p>

<p>Underwood was stunned. He staggered through
the horrible uproar toward the door. He longed for
the air outside, even the heavy air of lower Clark
street, where the people surged along under the wild,
dazzling lights, in two opposite, ever-passing processions.
His head reeled. He lost the sense of
things, the voices about him seemed far away and
vague, he felt himself detached, as it were, from all
that had gone before. But as he pressed his way
through the crowd that blocked the entrance, and
plunged toward the stairs, he saw Baldwin, mopping
the red band on his white brow. Baldwin recognized
him, and said, with his everlasting smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, my boy&mdash;next time!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MALACHI NOLAN</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">MALACHI NOLAN sat by the roll-top desk
in the front window of his saloon. The desk
was unopened, for Malachi seldom had occasion to
use it. The only letters he ever wrote were to
whisky houses in Peoria or Louisville, and then the
process was a painful one. His mighty haunches
completely filled the chair, which, in turn, completely
filled the space railed off in front of the partition
that screened the bar. The saloon was in a basement
in Dearborn Street, and, to get to it, you had to go
down four stone steps, hollowed by countless feet
in the long years he had kept there. Outside, over
the door, a long, black sign bore his simple device&mdash;M.
Nolan.</p>

<p>Malachi Nolan sat with his back to the window.
His cropped gray hair showed his red scalp, the hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
red skin on his face was closely shaven and shone
on the points of his heavy jaw. In the round hole
at the corner of his broad mouth was one of the long
succession of cigars that had worn away the hole,
sending up its perpetual incense. He never removed
the cigar and seldom puffed it. It seemed to smoke
of its own volition, and lasted a long time. When
it consumed itself, Malachi replaced it with another.
No one had ever seen him without a cigar in that
hole at the side of his mouth. When he moved his
thin lips to speak the cigar would stand out rigidly
between his teeth. He spoke with his teeth clenched.
He was in his shirt-sleeves, and his shirt was clean
and fresh, for he changed his linen daily, just as
he shaved himself, relentlessly, every morning with
a dull razor. On his glossy shirt front a great diamond,
four carats in weight, sparkled leisurely as
his enormous chest slowly rose and fell with his
heavy breathing. This diamond was the central
jewel of his alderman&#8217;s gold star, presented by constituents
years before. The setting was so contrived
that the stone could be unscrewed and made to
serve as a stud. Malachi seldom wore the star,
unless he went to a fire, or to a prize-fight across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
Indiana line, or to the Olympic Theater, or got
drunk.</p>

<p>As he sat there in his warm saloon on this raw
March morning, Malachi read his paper, read it
carefully and slowly, first the front page, column
after column, then the second page, and so on,
methodically, through all the pages, except the editorials,
which he skipped. His lips moved slightly
as he read, for he had to pronounce the words to
himself in order to get their full meaning. He read
his paper thus every morning of his life, and his
paper was all he ever did read.</p>

<p>Malachi sat this morning, as on every other morning
of the year, heavy, imponderable and solemn.
The hour was ten o&#8217;clock. It was too early for business
to begin in that saloon, so that the old bartender,
who had been with Malachi for fifteen years, sat
with his apron in his lap, against the whisky barrels
that reached in rows from the slot machine back to
the wooden stalls where many a campaign in the
city council had been planned and its victory celebrated.
The bartender was likewise reading a paper,
the sporting news chiefly claiming his attention. By
noon, aldermen and city hall employees would begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
to drop in, and the place would liven up, but now
the monotonous ticking of the Western Union clock
on the wall could be heard all over the long room,
and the big Maltese cat snoozed lazily at one end of
the bar.</p>

<p>Malachi was not feeling as well as usual this
morning, though his exterior was as clean and calm
as ever. A fever burned beneath his great waistcoat,
and on coming down he had drunk a bottle of mineral
water. The truth is, that the night before,
Malachi had so far departed from the habit of his
methodical life as to drink much whisky, a thing he
had not done for years, ever since the occasion, in
fact, when celebrating a re&euml;lection to the council,
he had drunk so much that he was constrained to
enter a barber shop in State Street, and terrorize the
barbers by sticking all the razors in the floor, like a
juggler he had seen playing with knives in a theater.
The gang had been in the saloon until three o&#8217;clock
that morning. They had just passed an ordinance
granting a new franchise to the Metropolitan Motor
Company, and in one of the walnut stalls the bundle
had been cut, as the phrase is. The gang had grown
so hilarious, as it always did on such occasions, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
it had proposed a song by Malachi. Now, in his
younger days, Malachi had been a great lad for song,
and many a shindig in Bridgeport had he gladdened
with his voice, but in the latter years it was seldom
that he could be induced to exercise it. He would
always plead his age and his flesh, and such was the
solemnity of manner that had grown upon him with
the years, that men in their sober hours never had
the temerity to suggest anything so unbecoming his
dignity. But on this night, heated by wine, and
feeling, though they did not of course analyze the
feeling, that so many improprieties had been committed
that one more could not noticeably swell the
score, they had been emboldened to demand a song.
Malachi, standing by his own bar in his long frock
coat and square-crowned stiff hat, twiddling his
whisky glass just as if he were a casual visitor there,
had resolutely shaken his head. But at two o&#8217;clock
in the morning he had suddenly ordered the drinks
for the house, and then, when the gang had given
over all hope of his singing, save, perhaps, one or
two who, deeper in their cups than the rest, had
monotonously persisted in the invitation, he had
spontaneously burst forth:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Oh, Paddy, dear, and did you hear the news that&#8217;s going round?</div>
<div class="verse">The shamrock is forbid by law to grow on Irish ground.</div>
<div class="verse">St. Patrick&#8217;s day no more we&#8217;ll keep, his colors can&#8217;t be seen,</div>
<div class="verse">For there&#8217;s a bloody law ag&#8217;in the wearin&#8217; of the green.</div>
<div class="verse">I met with Napper Tandy, and he took me by the hand,</div>
<div class="verse">And he said, &#8216;How&#8217;s poor old Ireland, and how does she stand?&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And then the gang, unable to hold its enthusiasm,
bellowed in chorus with the sadly cracked voice,
which, nevertheless, retained the true old Irish lilt:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;She&#8217;s the most distressful country that ever yet was seen,</div>
<div class="verse">They are hangin&#8217; men and women for the wearin&#8217; of the green.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>They had sung it over and over, prolonging to a
greater extent with each repetition the high note
upon which in the song the word &#8220;men&#8221; falls. Once
in tune, it was not so difficult to get Malachi to sing
other songs, and he gave them, with the genuine
flavor of the old sod, <i>Garryowen</i>. The gang became
uproarious when he reached the stanza:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Johnny Connell&#8217;s tall and straight,</div>
<div class="verse">And in his limbs he is complate,</div>
<div class="verse">He&#8217;ll pitch a bar of any weight</div>
<div class="verse">From Garryowen to Thomond gate.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>But the climax was reached when Malachi was
at last induced to sing <i>The Night Before Larry
Was Stretched</i>. This had taken time and diplomacy,
for the more popular the song, the more difficult
it was to prevail upon him to sing it, though at
last he yielded, and the gang restrained itself as
he began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">
&#8220;The night before Larry was stretched,</div>
<div class="indent">The boys they all paid him a visit,</div>
<div class="verse">A bit in their sacks too they fetched,</div>
<div class="indent">They sweated their duds till they riz it:</div>
<div class="verse">For Larry was always the lad,</div>
<div class="indent">When a friend was condemned to the squeezer,</div>
<div class="verse">But he&#8217;d fence all the togs that he had</div>
<div class="indent">Just to help the poor boy to a sneezer,</div>
<div class="indent">And moisten his gob &#8217;fore he died.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The lagging last line was too much, and in their
mad delight they began to pound Malachi familiarly
on the back. And then he froze stiffly, drew himself
up, ordered his cab and went home, and the song
was never finished.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>But now that morning had come and reason had
returned with the light, he felt a chagrin at having
suffered such a lapse in his dignity, and such a break
in the resolution of years, and so was more solemn
than ever.</p>

<p>When Malachi had read to the last line of the
last column of the last page of his newspaper, he did
not fold it and lay it aside as he did every other
morning of the year. He turned to the first page
and studied the picture there. It was the daily cartoon,
and the central figure was intended for Malachi
himself. That there could be no question of
identity, the prudent artist had labeled it &#8220;Bull
Nolan.&#8221; The figure was one that Malachi had seen
in the newspapers in varying situations for years,
and the aldermanic paunch, with massive chain and
charm, the bullet head, with its stubble of hair and
bell-crowned hat, the checked and braided clothes,
the broad-soled shoes and checkered spats, the
briskly radiating lines to symbolize his diamond,
were supposed to embody the popular conception
of the alderman&#8217;s personality. The inevitable cigar
had fallen and lay fuming at his feet, the eyes and
mouth gaped in palpable fear, and with a fat hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
flashing other diamonds, this counterfeit presentment
of Malachi Nolan was trying to protect the
First Ward&mdash;peeping on a ballot from his waistcoat
pocket&mdash;from a gentleman with high hat, side
whiskers, gloves and cane, who, labeled &#8220;Citizen,&#8221;
obviously impersonated the better element. The
point of the cartoon was that the Municipal Reform
League had resolved that Malachi Nolan be retired
from public life. The League had had a banquet,
and the speeches had breathed a zeal of reform such
as only champagne and truffles can inspire. The
resolutions rang like a declaration of independence;
if the reform candidate, a gentleman of prominent
probity, were beaten in regular convention, they
would nominate him by petition.</p>

<p>Malachi studied the cartoon a long time, never
changing expression, and when he finished, he
folded the paper carefully and laid it on his desk,
bestowed his spectacles in his waistcoat pocket, and
then, placing a hand on each knee, sat and stared
with widening eyes straight before him.</p>

<p>It was not a new experience to be thus caricatured.
He had long since acquired a politician&#8217;s stoicism
and could affect a reassuring indifference to attacks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
of the press; indeed, if a newspaper happened to
elude him and slip into Nora&#8217;s hands, he could even
pretend to like it. But this cartoon roused the fighting
Irish in him.</p>

<p>Malachi had promised himself to retire from politics
that spring, though his wary habit had kept him
from taking the public into his confidence. He
was rich, though not rich enough to give up saloon-keeping
and become a contractor or a broker, and he
had lately got the notion that he was growing old.
But this successful politician, who so long before had
landed in New York a homesick emigrant, had one
great ambition unfulfilled. It was the common ambition
of the exile&mdash;to see his home once more.
When first elected to the council, after toiling years
to save enough for his first small saloon, he had
found, in the sentimental manner of his race, his
chief joy in the fact that it was in the character of
an ex-alderman he could go home to Ireland. Fate,
of course, with her usual irony, had embittered his
joy; Molly had died that very spring, she had not
been spared even long enough to see him take his
seat in the council chamber behind the one pathetic
floral piece his constituents had placed upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
desk, but had left him to sit beside the candles at
her wake, with lonesome little Nora crying at his
knee. He felt that he had earned a rest. He had
worked hard, mastered the intricate details of the
water office and the special assessment bureau; he
had done his part in making a town of wooden sidewalks
a city of steel and stone; he had never
betrayed his party or his friend. As for certain of
his methods, well&mdash;if he thought of them at all&mdash;they
were direct, and they won. So now that Nora
was grown and had finished her education at St.
Aloysius, he had decided to retire and take her with
him on the long-dreamed-of trip back to Ireland&mdash;Ireland,
where it was really spring that very morning.</p>

<p>But he wished to retire gracefully, to name his
successor before he went, and how could he do this
with the reformers making the fight of their lives
against him? It would take Malachi Nolan some
time to decide a question like that. He must think.
Nora was young; after all, another term would
make little difference; if he concluded to give some
more lessons in practical politics to the reformers,
she could take some more lessons on the piano.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>Meanwhile, like a wise statesman, Malachi Nolan
set about his day&#8217;s work. He had enough to keep
him busy, so, drawing out his gold watch he carefully
compared it with the clock, grasped the hour,
rose deliberately, settled his ponderous body on
his thick legs, and withdrew behind the partition.
When he emerged to view again he was wrapped in
his frieze overcoat, with his square-crowned hat
pulled down to his eyebrows, ready for his morning
visit to the city hall.</p>

<p>His progress over the great building was constantly
impeded by men who stepped out of the
rushing throngs of lawyers and lawyers&#8217; clerks, city
employees, court officials and politicians to shake
hands with him, to whisper to him. He halted each
time in a way that did not impair his Hibernian
dignity, heard them with gravity, and walked on.
He went to the water office to see why young Hennessey
had been laid off; to the civil service commission
to find out what opportunities the sixty-day
list afforded; to the commissioner of public works
to have some laborers put on the pay-roll; to the
board of election commissioners to give in a list
of certain constituents he desired to have appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
as extra clerks during the spring rush of work. He
dropped in on the chief of police to get Murphy on
the force; he saw the city clerk about a good fellow
who had to be taken care of; he even followed the
long hall to the court-house wing, where he whispered
an instant to Judge Peters and had a friend
excused from the jury.</p>

<p>And then he called on the mayor. A lieutenant
of police, in gold stripes and stars, the velvet cuffs
of his blue coat scrupulously brushed, was just going
in. When the officer came out, the big policeman
standing guard at the door raised his hand in a
semi-military salute, and he kept a finger at his
forehead until Malachi entered, thus declaring his
abiding faith in the alderman&#8217;s political star, and
his concern for his own official one.</p>

<p>The mayor sat at his great, square desk, with that
look of nervous weariness Chicago gives the faces
of its successful men, though the morning was
young and the day&#8217;s strain scarce begun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Alderman,&#8221; he said with a sigh, &#8220;what
can I do for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Misther May&#8217;r,&#8221; said Nolan, &#8220;I come fer to
ask a favor.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>The shade of weariness under the mayor&#8217;s eyes
enveloped his brow, although he tried to wipe it out
with his palm. Everybody came every day to ask
favors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Alderman,&#8221; he said, turning away fretfully,
&#8220;I know. Please don&#8217;t ask me to interfere in
your fight this spring. I&#8217;ll promise to keep hands
off and leave you alone. Ain&#8217;t that enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who said annything about my fight?&#8221; said Malachi.
&#8220;It&#8217;s time enough to saay good marnin&#8217; to
th&#8217; divil whin ye meet &#8217;im, Jawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mayor looked a bit relieved, and turned
toward Malachi with half a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Alderman, I supposed, of course&mdash;But
what can I do for you?&#8221; He repeated his
formula.</p>

<p>Malachi seated himself, and dangling his hat between
his knees, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s a laad from my waard in the Bridewell,
Jawn, an&#8217; he&#8217;s a mother who&#8217;s wallopin&#8217; a wash-board
be th&#8217; daay an&#8217; night fer to make a livin&#8217;.
His name&#8217;s James McGlone, an&#8217; I&#8217;m afther a paardon
fer &#8217;im.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mayor scowled. &#8220;What&#8217;s he in for?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>&#8220;Damned if I know,&#8221; said Malachi; &#8220;he&#8217;s all the
time in wan shcrape or anither with some o&#8217; thim
bla&#8217;gyaards down there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mayor was turning a long blue pencil over
and over, end for end, between his white fingers,
making a series of monotonous tappings on his desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you wait till after election?&#8221; he said at
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;His time&#8217;ll be served out befoore that,&#8221; said
Malachi, &#8220;an&#8217; ph&#8217;at good&#8217;ll a paardon do &#8217;im thin?&#8221;</p>

<p>The mayor continued the thoughtful tapping with
his long blue pencil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Alderman,&#8221; he said after a while, &#8220;I&#8217;d
rather not issue any pardons before election, if I can
help it. These reformers are going to raise hell
this spring, sticking their noses into everybody&#8217;s
business, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Malachi&#8217;s little eyes contracted until their blue
twinkle was almost hidden.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Jawn,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so much the more r&#8217;ason
why ye&#8217;ll want the Firsht in th&#8217; convintion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; said the mayor, &#8220;if it&#8217;s important&mdash;&#8221;
And he pressed a button under his desk. Before
his secretary appeared he added:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>&#8220;You say you don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s in for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dinnaw,&#8221; Malachi replied, &#8220;Mallett sint him up
befoore I could git over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to watch those things more closely,
Alderman,&#8221; chided the mayor peevishly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Malachi Nolan sat at twilight with a glass of hot
toddy on the leaf of his desk, and he sipped it with
heavy sighs, for he had taken cold out in the March
weather, with pores opened by the relaxations of
the night before. Through his windows he could
see the lights glimmering in the rain that had followed
the moist snow of the early morning, and
thousands of feet trudging by under rolled-up trousers
or skirts held ankle high. At intervals the feet
would line up along the curb waiting for North Side
cable-cars, and seeing them paddle in the dirty slush,
Malachi in the selfish spirit of contrast, more than
ever coddled in the warmth of the room, of the
toddy over which he smacked his lips, and of the
cigar he smoked so slowly and comfortably. As
he sat and smoked and sipped, he thought again
of Limerick&mdash;the breath of spring blows the fragrance
of the hawthorne, white upon the bough; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
hears the song of the mavis; he is walking homeward
along the black path through the bog, and up
the green boreen, and there before him is the little
cottage, its thatch held down by sticks and stones,
a long ash pole propping up its crumbling gable;
there is the mud shed with the thills of the old cart
sticking out of it; the donkey is standing by, sad as
ever; and up the muddy lane little Annie in her bare
feet is driving the cows to the byre; and then he
sees his mother sitting in the low doorway, all at
once he catches his first whiff of the peat smoke, and
with the strange spell that odors work upon the
memory, it makes him a boy again; again he is sheltered
on a rainy day in the mud shed, playing shoot-marbles
with Andy Corrigan and Jerry O&#8217;Brien;
again he is in the little chapel with the leaky roof;
he sees all the boys and girls&mdash;Mary Cassidy among
them&mdash;standing on the bare clay floor; he brings
his bit of stone to kneel on during mass, he even
runs out for a piece of slate to give to Mary, who
lays it in the puddle at her feet and spreads her handkerchief
over it before she kneels. And when the
mass is over he will take little Nora&mdash;little Nora?
He placed his hand to his forehead in confusion, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
then in a gasp it all comes over him&mdash;Mary is old,
Andy and Jerry are old, little Annie is old and he
is old&mdash;they are all gone away. He bowed his head.</p>

<p>And yet Nora yearned to go. Should he turn the
ward over to Brennan and take her this spring? He
could run for the legislature when he came back in
the fall; a senator would be elected by the next general
assembly, and the graft would be very good
then. The compromise attracted Malachi, for at
once it acquitted him of indecision, a quality of
statesmanship he hated, and kept for him the life
of power that had become as the very breath of his
nostrils. He would have been happy but for this
stuffy cold, and even as it was he smacked his lips
and fetched a long sigh, as he put down the glass.</p>

<p>And then the door opened, and a chill, wet wind
blew in, causing him to start up out of his chair.
He looked to see who it was that thus broke upon
his reveries&mdash;and it was a woman! Now, a woman
had never been in Malachi Nolan&#8217;s place before. It
was a thing he could never tolerate, if he could ever
imagine it even, and he hastily glanced around to
see how many men were at the bar, and who they
were. His face showed positive alarm. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
woman entered. She was accompanied by a boy,
who slouched in behind her, shutting the door at
her solicitous command, and halted there, hanging
his head. His eyes shifted suspiciously under the
hat brim that shadowed his sallow, prematurely
wrinkled face; his lips curled in an evil sneer that
seemed habitual.</p>

<p>The woman fluttered her shawl about her shoulders,
clutched it to her thin breast with one hand,
while the other she stretched forth with a blessing,
as it were, for Malachi, and as she spoke, her seamed
and scarred old Irish face, bleached in the steam of
many wash-days and framed in withered black bonnet
strings, glowed with the light of mother-love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Praise be, Mal&#8217;chi Nol&#8217;n,&#8221; she began, in a high
voice that immediately stifled the clinking of glasses
and the laughter behind the partition. &#8220;May God
bless ye&mdash;ye&#8217;re th&#8217; foinest man in th&#8217; whole town!
To think of yer l&#8217;avin&#8217; th&#8217; laad out th&#8217; way ye did&mdash;an&#8217;
so soon afther me havin&#8217; th&#8217; impidence to ask
ye, too&mdash;shure a mither&#8217;s blessin&#8217; an&#8217; th&#8217; blessin&#8217; of
th&#8217; Vargin&#8217;ll be on ye fer gettin&#8217; th&#8217; paardon fer
&#8217;im. Shtep up here, Jamesy, and t&#8217;ank Misther
Nol&#8217;n yersilf&mdash;he&#8217;s th&#8217; best man&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>&#8220;Aw, tut, tut, tut, now, Misthress McGlone,&#8221; said
Malachi, his face flaming with something more than
the exertion of craning his neck to peer behind the
partition, &#8220;tut, tut, now, don&#8217;t be goin&#8217; on like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the woman, brave in the one subject upon
which she could dispute the alderman, persisted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shure, Mal&#8217;chi Nol&#8217;n, ye know it yersilf&mdash;shtep
up here, Jamesy, an&#8217; make yer t&#8217;anks to &#8217;im. Th&#8217;
laad&#8217;s a bit bashful, ye must excuse &#8217;im, sor, he&#8217;s th&#8217;
best b&#8217;y ever lived, though it&#8217;s mesilf says it p&#8217;hat
oughtn&#8217;t to.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy still hung back, but the old woman hitching
up the shawl that was shamelessly revealing the
moth-eaten waist she wore, plucked him by the
sleeve, and dragged him to the rail that separated
them from Malachi. The boy jerked away from
his mother&#8217;s grasp, yet lifted his unsteady eyes for
an instant to blurt out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m much obliged, see?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, as if ashamed of so much politeness, he
hung his head and squeezed the toe of his shoe
between the spokes of the railing. The old woman
folded her arms in the shawl and gazed on him with
a fond smile that showed the few loose, yellow teeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
that always wobbled in their gums when she spoke.
Presently she turned to Malachi again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye mustn&#8217;t think haard o&#8217; him, Misther Nol&#8217;n,
he&#8217;s a bit back&#8217;ard shp&#8217;akin&#8217; to th&#8217; loikes o&#8217; ye, ye
moind, but he&#8217;s a good b&#8217;y, an&#8217; he&#8217;d never got into
throuble if it hadn&#8217;t been for this bad comp&#8217;ny he
be&#8217;s dhragged into. Shure, he niver shtays out
later&#8217;n tin o&#8217;clock o&#8217; noights widout tellin&#8217; me p&#8217;here
he&#8217;s been. This afthernoon Oi was shcrubbin&#8217;
awaay all alone, an&#8217; who should come in all o&#8217; a
suddint but him, bless th&#8217; b&#8217;y, an&#8217; saay, &#8216;Ma,&#8217; he says,
&#8216;Alderman Nol&#8217;n got me a paardon an&#8217; Oi&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Misthress McGlone&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; God&#8217;ll bless ye, sor,&#8221; the old woman broke
in, unable to restrain the flood of tears that filled
her filmy eyes and zigzagged down her cheeks. She
cried softly a moment, then suddenly looked up in
a crafty, cunning way.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s wan thing, Misther Nol&#8217;n,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;some wan was so good,&#8221; she looked all about to
make sure that none was within hearing, and lowered
her voice to a rough whisper, &#8220;as to sind me a
ton o&#8217; coal in a pushcaart th&#8217; day. Oi wonder now
who could that be?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>The alderman raised his heavy face with fine innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did it come from?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Misther Degnan&#8217;s yaards,&#8221; the woman answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thin I suppose&#8217;t was Degnan himsilf sint it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, there now!&#8221; the old woman cried, with the
triumph of a vindicated prophet. &#8220;Oi knowed ye&#8217;d
saay that, Oi knowed ye&#8217;d saay that&mdash;but, shure Oi
think&#8217;t was yersilf done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;L&#8217;ave off, l&#8217;ave off, now,&#8221; said Malachi almost
roughly, &#8220;&#8217;tis no place, do ye mind, fer a woman,
an&#8217; no place fer th&#8217; laad.&#8221; He gave the boy a penetrating
glance that made the shifting eyes fall suddenly.
&#8220;An&#8217; &#8217;tis late&mdash;did ye come down on th&#8217;
caar?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman&#8217;s tears running down her cheeks
had left stains in the wrinkles, and she began
plucking at something under her shawl. Presently
she drew forth a handkerchief folded in a soft
little white square, fresh and clean from the iron,
and shaking it out she dabbed at her weak old eyes
and wiped away the tear stains. Her voice was a
whisper again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>&#8220;Aw, Misther Nol&#8217;n,&#8221; she began, &#8220;it&#8217;s been a
haard winther on the poor, an&#8217; Oi&#8217;ve had to save
th&#8217; pinnies, shure they&#8217;re scarce enough, an&#8217; th&#8217;
laad with no job an&#8217; me a poor widow woman. God
forgive me&#8221;&mdash;her voice sank still lower, and into
the whisper came a hard, rebellious note&mdash;&#8220;but some
noights Oi&#8217;ve gone without me supper&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t ye tell?&#8221; asked Malachi, looking
up in concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi&#8217;d die first!&#8221; she whispered hoarsely, while
her wet eyes blazed. &#8220;It&#8217;ll niver be said Oi&#8217;m a beggar,
an&#8217; Oi wouldn&#8217;t have tould anny wan but you,
sor&#8221;&mdash;she gave him a coaxing smile through her
tears, and bent her head to one side in a way that
seemed to recall her girlhood&mdash;&#8220;an&#8217; maybe, sor,
ye&#8217;d not saay annything &#8217;bout it&mdash;there&#8217;s a good
man, now. Oi&#8217;ve kep&#8217; up th&#8217; insurance an&#8217; there&#8217;ll
be enough to give me a dacent bur&#8217;al whin Oi die.
Ye&#8217;ll excuse me fer&#8221;&mdash;she stretched a hand from
the shawl and touched him on the shoulder&mdash;&#8220;fer
runnin&#8217; on loike this, but Oi couldn&#8217;t shlape th&#8217;
noight till Oi&#8217;d come down to thank ye&mdash;God
bless ye, sor, Oi&#8217;ll pray fer ye every noight.
We&#8217;ll be goin&#8217; now.&#8221; She took a step toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
door, but turned back again, with that pleading inclination
of the head, that smile, showing her long,
wabbling teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye must excuse me, sor,&#8221; she said, &#8220;fer throublin&#8217;
ye so, but ye&#8217;re a koind, saft-hearted man&mdash;ye
couldn&#8217;t git th&#8217; laad a job now&mdash;shure Oi know ye
couldn&#8217;t&mdash;he&#8217;s an hones&#8217; b&#8217;y an&#8217; a willin&#8217; worker,
sor, whin he can git annything to do&mdash;ye must
excuse me, sor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Malachi was deeply chagrined. He actually got
up and peeped again around the corner of the partition,
and then said hastily, so as to close a painful
and scandalous incident:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let th&#8217; b&#8217;y come down an&#8217; see me in th&#8217; marnin&#8217;,
ma&#8217;am, an&#8217; here&#8217;s a bit o&#8217; caar fare fer ye. Do ye
go now an&#8217; take th&#8217; caar home. &#8217;Tis a long waays
fer ye to walk, ye niver ought a done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman objected at first, but finally consented
to accept the coin on the basis of a loan, and
then, blessing him again and again, courtesied herself
in an old-fashioned, rheumatic way out of the
door. And then Malachi tilted up his glass and
drained the last drop. The toddy had grown quite
cold.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>The law of moral reaction sent the gang home
early that evening, and by ten o&#8217;clock it was plain
that the day&#8217;s work was done. Malachi had the bartender
help him on with the frieze overcoat, and was
adjusting his hat to a skull that still was sore, when
the door opened. Malachi turned with a scowl, when
the draft struck him, and saw Sullivan, the ward
committeeman, and Brennan, Malachi&#8217;s political residuary
legatee. Brennan&#8217;s eyes were sparkling merrily,
his red face was round with laughter, and he
came in with a breeze like the March day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Mal&#8217;chi,&#8221; he called, smiting the bar with
the thick of his fist, &#8220;ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; home, are you? It&#8217;s
just the shank of the evening. What&#8217;ll you have?&#8221;
Then, as one who likes to think he has special privileges,
he said to the bartender aside: &#8220;Give&#8217;s a nice
little drink of whisky.&#8221;</p>

<p>Malachi neither moved nor spoke. Brennan felt
his coldness and flashed the intelligence to Sullivan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just saw Jim Degnan,&#8221; he said, grasping the
sweating whisky bottle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did, did you?&#8221; said Malachi, in a challenging
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Brennan, determined to be genial.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
&#8220;He tells me you&#8217;re goin&#8217; back to Ireland in the
spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He does, does he?&#8221; again challenged Nolan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you tell &#8217;im?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I did, did I tell &#8217;im phat spring?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I s&#8217;posed as a matter of course he meant
this spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brennan bent over to measure his drink and to
hide some confusion. &#8220;And I thought&mdash;you know
what you said, Mal&#8217;chi&mdash;I was goin&#8217; to have Mike
here call the convention and round up the nomination&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; hell you was! Th&#8217;&mdash;hell&mdash;you&mdash;was!&#8221; Malachi&#8217;s
growing amazement lengthened the pauses between
his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, didn&#8217;t you say you&#8217;d t&#8217;row the nomination
to me when you quit?&#8221;</p>

<p>Brennan&#8217;s color deepened to an angry red.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did ye iver see such narve!&#8221; said Malachi, ignoring
the question. &#8220;Mike&#8217;ll call th&#8217; convintion fer
soon enough, but whin I&#8217;m not a candydate in me
own waard, I&#8217;ll tell ye mesilf, Willum Brennan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t get mad about it, Mal&#8217;chi,&#8221; said
Brennan, who was getting mad himself. He shoved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
the bottle on to Sullivan, and blinked his small eyelids
a moment. &#8220;Of course, Mal&#8217;chi, it&#8217;s just as you
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, ye&#8217;re talkin&#8217;, Willum.&#8221; Malachi
never could brook anything like interference in his
ruling of the First Ward. &#8220;Whin I&#8217;m done, ye can
have th&#8217; nomination, same&#8217;s I told ye, but this spring
I&#8217;m a candydate mesilf, do ye mind that now?&#8221; He
drew closer to the bar in his softened humor, and
now that the question at last had been decided, and
in the only way it could have been decided, he suddenly
became himself again.</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you want the convention called for,
Mr. Nolan?&#8221; asked Sullivan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sathurday,&#8221; replied Malachi promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, same as usual&mdash;in the back ind of th&#8217; plaace
here.&#8221; Malachi jerked his thick thumb toward the
rear end of the saloon, where the gloom was deep.
&#8220;Prim&#8217;ries fer Friday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Sullivan.</p>

<p>Then no one spoke for a while. Finally, however,
Brennan said, in a hesitating way:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re goin&#8217; back to the council, Mal&#8217;chi,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
what&#8217;s the matter with me takin&#8217; the legislative
nomination in the district?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time enough to saay good marnin&#8217; to th&#8217;
divil whin ye meet &#8217;im, Willum.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence again, until Brennan said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t help thinkin&#8217; it&#8217;s a fine trip to Ireland
you&#8217;re losin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis so,&#8221; assented Malachi.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; sighed Brennan. And he saw his ambition
pass from him. But presently he was saying in his
old, cheery tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you goin&#8217; to take somethin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Malachi leaned his big body against his bar, and
over his shoulder, out of the corner of his mouth, he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Seegaar.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bartender slid the box along the counter and
rang up another ten cents on the cash register.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s lookin&#8217; at you,&#8221; said Brennan, raising
the little tumbler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dhrink heaarty,&#8221; said Malachi Nolan.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The long day was done, and Malachi, in shirt-sleeves
and stockinged feet, sat in his big plush rocking-chair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
his legs stretched out before him, taking
his ease at his own hearth. When he had come home
at midnight, Nora, who always sat up for him, had
insisted upon brewing him a cup of tea, under the
impression, common to a certain class of women,
that it has great medicinal qualities. Malachi had
sipped it obediently, though he had not cared for it
after all the mineral waters he had drunk that day,
and had enjoyed far more than the tea the freckled
Irish face of his daughter, as he gravely goggled at
her over the rim of the saucer into which he had
poured the beverage to cool it. They were in what
Malachi called the parlor of their flat, though Nora
had lately taken to calling it the drawing-room. It
was furnished mostly in pieces upholstered in plush.
Over the mantelpiece hung a large crayon portrait of
a woman whose face, despite the insipidity the canvasing
artist had given it, still showed the toil she
had endured, if it told little of her strong character,
while that disregard for expense which was expressed
in the gilt frame marked it as a memorial
of the dead. It was, of course, the face of Malachi&#8217;s
wife, and when Nora, in her new culture, had hinted
at hanging it in his bedroom, she had, for the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
time in her life, quailed before that stubborn spirit
with which her father ruled the First Ward. The
few books on the center-table treated mostly of religious
subjects, though there were queer bound volumes
of Irish poetry, and on the wall there were one
or two etchings in oaken frames. In a corner was a
crucifix with a candle before it. But the one object
in the room that dominated all the rest with its
aggressive worldliness, was an upright piano, and
Nora now sat swinging on the stool, her back to the
instrument, her elbows behind her on the keys. She
had partly prepared for bed, for she wore a flannel
wrapper and her brilliant black hair hung in a braid
down her back. Celtic blue eyes lighted up her face,
and now they smiled under their long, black lashes
upon this big saloon-keeper whom half the city
feared, as if the simple sight of him were reward
enough for her long hours of waiting.</p>

<p>Malachi finished his cup of tea and hurriedly inserted
a cigar in the hole at the corner of his mouth,
and thus confirmed in comfort, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nora, child, do ye sing now&mdash;phat was that&mdash;it
wint hummin&#8217; t&#8217;rough me head th&#8217; daay. Well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
well, well, let me see now&mdash;hum-m-m-m&mdash;it goes
something like&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And he hummed a quavering old tune:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;&#8216;I saw the Shannon&#8217;s purple flood</div>
<div class="indent2">Flow by the Irish town.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then he stopped and shook his grizzled head.
&#8220;Shure, now, I&#8217;m forgettin&#8217; it intirely; ye know,
though, somethin&#8217; about:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
&#8220;&#8216;Whin down the glin rode Sarsfield&#8217;s min,</div>
<div class="indent2">And they wore the jackets green.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Sing it onct, fer th&#8217; ould man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father,&#8221; the girl laughed, though she began
screwing up the piano stool, &#8220;it&#8217;s too late, the neighbors
will object.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Niver mind th&#8217; neighbors,&#8221; commanded the alderman
in the tone he used at a primary, &#8220;sing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s forbidden in the lease after ten o&#8217;clock,&#8221;
the girl protested, leafing over her music. &#8220;What if
the landlord&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to say good marnin&#8217; to th&#8217; divil, Nora,
whin ye meet &#8217;im.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nora fixed herself on the stool, fingered the keys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
finding a soft minor chord. The old man closed his
eyes, slid farther down in his plush chair, and just
as he was prepared to listen, she suddenly stopped
in the provoking way amateur musicians cultivate,
to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father, that&#8217;s such an old song, wouldn&#8217;t
you rather I&#8217;d sing the Intermezzo from <i>Cavalerie</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Malachi opened his eyes with a start and sat bolt
upright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw,&#8221; he said, &#8220;none o&#8217; thim fur&#8217;n op&#8217;res&mdash;phat&#8217;s
the use of yer goin&#8217; to th&#8217; convint all those
years?&#8221; But his voice quickly softened. &#8220;Do ye go
on now, Nora, darlin&#8217;, there&#8217;s a good gur-rl.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so she sang, and the alderman sank in his
chair, with his big arms in their shirt-sleeves thrown
over his head, closed his eyes again, stretched out
his stockinged feet. The smoke from his cigar ascended
to the chandelier, and now and then when he
remembered the words of a line, he hummed them
behind closed lips, in unison with his daughter.
When the song was done Nora whirled around,
clasped her hands in a school-girl&#8217;s ecstasy and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, father, that song makes me homesick&mdash;homesick
for a place I never saw. You won&#8217;t run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
again, will you, father, will you? And we&#8217;ll go to
Ireland in the spring, won&#8217;t we? Tell me, in the
spring?&#8221;</p>

<p>A pain struck through Malachi Nolan&#8217;s heart, a
pain that was made only more poignant when, with
her American fear of the sentimental, Nora joked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see our ancestral cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Malachi could not open his eyes. For once he was
afraid. He did not move for a long time. But at
last he sighed and set his jaw, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Nora&mdash;if ye saay so&mdash;in the spring.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Malachi Nolan sat bolt upright in his seat in the
Pullman. He was clothed in his decent black suit,
and he wore his black cravat tucked stiffly under the
collar that so tightly bound his thick, red neck. On
his glossy shirt front the great diamond, four carats
in weight, rose and fell with his heavy breathing.
At his feet was a new yellow valise; beside him,
wedging him tightly into his seat, was Nora&#8217;s luggage,
her new bag, the roll of steamer rugs, her little
umbrella, her plaid cape, and all the things she had
got at the suggestion of friends who were interested
in her journey across the sea to Ireland. Nora, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
her new traveling gown, was prettier than Malachi
had ever seen her. She sat in the front seat of the
section, leaning against the double window, her elbow
on its narrow sill, her chin meditatively in her
palm. There had been some talk between them as
the heavy train pulled out of the Van Buren Street
station, and in the bustle of getting away, of arranging
her bags and her bundles, and all that, Nora had
beamed with pleasure, and a fine and happy excitement
had sparkled through the long, black lashes of
her blue Irish eyes. But as the train plunged recklessly
out through the bewildering yards, she had
noticed her father casting wistful glances at this or
that familiar object sweeping so swiftly and irrevocably
away. There was the Harrison Street police
station which he had visited on so many mornings
to help some poor devil out of the toils; the shops
shutting down for the night, their workers trooping
homeward, dead tired after the long hours; the
Twelfth Street viaduct, marking the limits of his
ward; the slips in the south branch of the dirty Chicago
River, where big schooners still lay torpid at
their winter moorings, the crossings at Sixteenth
Street, then the dear old Archey Road. A silence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
had fallen upon him that reacted upon her, and she
grew still, and rode on in the swaying train, gazing
soberly out upon the ragged edges of that Chicago
she was leaving behind for the first time in her life.</p>

<p>The black porter, in spotless white jacket, was
going through the car with his stool, pulling down
the inverted globes of the lamps with his ventilating
stick and lighting the four little gas-jets; the travelers
in the car were settling themselves accustomedly
for the long ride to New York, there was even a
prospect of some cheer in the dinner which was soon
to be served in the dining-car, but the alderman
seemed not to notice any of these things.</p>

<p>Malachi had never traveled much. His only trips
had been those biennial ones to Springfield, when he
had headed the First Ward delegation to the state
conventions; sometimes he had gone down there
while the legislature was in session; and once he had
journeyed to Washington with the Marching Club
to attend the inauguration ceremonies. But that
was all. On these trips he had gone with his own
kind, and doubtless enjoyed them, but now, this
evening, it was plain that he was not comfortable.
He could not smoke, for one thing, and the round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
hole in the corner of his mouth looked forlorn in its
present lack of a cigar. He must have thought, once
or twice, of escaping to the smoking-room, but each
time he had remembered Nora, and so had sat on,
heavy, imponderable and solemn.</p>

<p>After a while the porter got the little lights to
burning, and they illumed, though inadequately, the
long coach, its heavy trappings, its bell cord, the suspended
hats and wraps swaying from side to side,
as it creaked and groaned over so many switches and
curves and crossings to get out of town. They
rushed by mills, with furnaces blazing like infernos
in the gathering twilight, and black, stubby chimneys
lighting the dull sky with flames; at last they
were in the outskirts where the city helplessly degenerates
into naked flat buildings, finally, into low
cottages scattered here and there in little broken
rows, with high board-walks in front of them.</p>

<p>Then Malachi, stooping painfully, unbuckled his
new valise and took from it a newspaper. Before he
unfolded it, he drew out his spectacles and calmly
adjusted them to his nose. Then opening the paper
he began to read. He read carefully and slowly,
first the front page, column after column, then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
second page, and so on, methodically, through all the
pages. His lips moved slightly as he read, for he
had to pronounce the words to himself to get their
full meaning. When Malachi had read to the last
line of the last column of the last page of his newspaper,
he did not fold and lay it aside. He turned
back to the first page and studied the picture there.
It was the daily cartoon, and the central figure was
intended for Malachi himself. That there could be
no question of identity, the prudent artist had
labeled it &#8220;Bull Nolan.&#8221; The figure was one that
Malachi had seen in the papers, in varying situations,
for years, with the aldermanic paunch, the massive
chain and charm, the bullet head, the stubble of hair,
the bell-crowned hat, the braided plaid clothes,
broad-soled shoes and checkered spats, the briskly
radiating lines to symbolize the diamond. But at
last the inevitable cigar had gone out, the First
Ward no longer peeped on a ballot, secure and safe,
from his waistcoat pocket. The gentleman with high
hat, side whiskers, gloves and cane, who, labeled
&#8220;Citizen,&#8221; impersonated the better element, had it
now, and while he was still self-contained, there was
a look of almost holy triumph in his face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>Malachi studied the cartoon a long time, never
changing expression. But even when he finished
he did not fold the paper carefully and put it back
in his valise, nor bestow his spectacles in his waistcoat
pocket. He had suffered many lapses in his
methodical habits of late, and they were growing
easy now. He turned to the editorial page, where
a line in big types, heading a leading editorial, had
caught his little eye. It said: &#8220;The Passing of Malachi
Nolan.&#8221; Malachi began to read, slowly and
carefully, pronouncing each word to himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Citizens not only of the First Ward, but of the
entire city, are to be congratulated upon the signal
victory the Municipal Reform League has won in its
campaign against Malachi Nolan. This man, who
so long has misrepresented the ward mentioned in
the city council, has at last been dislodged, and
driven to the obscurity of private life, where his
pernicious and dangerous tendencies, if not altogether
abated, will at least be confined to a narrower
sphere of activity. In announcing his retirement
from politics, he gives as a reason his desire to pay
a visit to his native land, but the public, while speeding
his departure, will readily penetrate the gauzy
excuse he advances for it. They know that he has
been forced to fly from a field rendered utterly untenable
by the onslaughts of those public-spirited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
gentlemen who at great personal sacrifice have so
freely contributed of their means, their energies and
their time to the work of the Municipal Reform
League, and to them and the press they will ascribe
the credit and the praise. It would seem, however,
that the Honorable Bull Nolan has lost none of his
presumption, for he insolently declares that he leaves
as his personal representative and successor in the
aldermanic chair one of his henchmen, William
Brennan. But the people will take care of Mr.
Brennan at the proper time. They will see to it that
Nolan&#8217;s successor shall not be a man whose political
methods are such as will enable him to take vacation
trips in Europe, and with the abundant encouragement
they have now received, will continue to widen
this breach already made in the walls of corruption
and dishonesty and carry on the splendid work for
good government and honest politics&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Malachi did not read any further. The lights in
the car were poor, after all, and then, his eyes were
not so good as they used to be. He folded the paper
carefully, looked all about, then hid it at last behind
him. Then he bestowed his spectacles in his waistcoat
pocket, and, like Nora, looked out of the window.
They had gone through South Chicago, they
had passed One-hundredth Street. They looked out
now upon the dull prairies that sprawled flat all
about them, with no sign of spring as yet, but dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
and desolate, broken only by a black and stunted
tree here or there. At wide, wide intervals a lonely
gas lamp twinkled bravely in a legal way as if to
preserve the prescription of what was only technically
a street. The prairies stretched away until
they faded into the gray gloom of the March evening,
and they had left Chicago at last behind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE PARDON
OF THOMAS WHALEN</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE private secretary turned reluctantly from
his open window beside which the trees bathed
their young leaves in the sparkling sunshine of the
June morning to confront the throng that awaited
audience with the governor. The throng was larger
than usual, for the state convention was to be held
on the morrow. Every county in the state was represented
in the crowd that trampled the red carpet,
crushed the leather chairs and blew the smoke of
campaign cigars into the solemn faces of former
governors standing in their massive gilt frames with
their hands on ponderous law books. In one corner
a woman huddled, pinching a handkerchief to her
eyes. Now and then she sobbed aloud. When
Leonard Gilman, the private secretary, saw her he
knew it at once for a pardon case, and paid no further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
attention to her. Big countrymen in Sunday
clothes, who wore the red badges of delegates,
slapped him on the back, city ward-heelers of checkered
lives and garments called him &#8220;Len.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an odor of perspiration in the room,
distinguishable even in the heavy fumes of tobacco.
The real leaders, of course, William Handy and the
others, were over at the executive mansion, with the
governor, completing the final arrangements for his
renomination. The governor held the convention in
the hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>The woman huddled in her corner until eleven
o&#8217;clock, and then Gilman, happening into her quarter
of the room, asked her what she wanted, listening
with official respect for her reply. It was an old
story to him. When she told him he smiled a strange
smile and turned away. At noon the governor ran
the gauntlet of the waiting crowd and gained the
sanctuary of his private office. Once there, breathing
a sigh of relief, he stood for a moment in one of
the tall windows looking out upon the smooth lawns
stretching lazily in the sun, and rolling away to the
elms surrounding the state house. He was a tall
man and strong. If he had a physical fault, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
that he carried his head too low, denoting him a
thinker, but if his gaze was fixed upon the earth,
his thoughts were in the stars. Presently he shook
his splendid head vigorously, wrapped his long coat
determinedly about him, and settled himself at his
desk.</p>

<p>Gilman entered, bearing a pile of papers demanding
the governor&#8217;s personal attention, but the morning
conference was very brief on this day. As
Gilman turned to go, the governor said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I desire to be alone to-day. I have that speech
of acceptance to write. If Handy comes, send him
in, but no one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gilman laid his hand upon the door-knob and the
governor asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;No one of importance out there, is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Gilman. &#8220;There&#8217;s a woman&mdash;what do
you think she wants?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A pardon, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but for whom? You&#8217;d never guess in a
thousand years.&#8221; Gilman was smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom Whalen!&#8221; Gilman laughed at the humor
of it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>The governor&#8217;s features relaxed with a smile, but
quickly his brow contracted again, and he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;poor things&mdash;I pity them. I could wash
my hands in women&#8217;s tears every week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Gilman, opening the door, &#8220;I told
her she could see you. I&#8217;ll slide her out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor bent to his desk, but just as the
door was closing he called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Gilman!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gilman stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that&mdash;tell her I&#8217;ll see her after a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gilman, as he returned to his desk, smiled and
shook his head at the governor&#8217;s weakness.</p>

<p>Thomas Whalen was a life convict in the penitentiary.
The crime was committed on the night of
the election at which John Chatham had been chosen
chief executive of his state. Whalen was a boss in
the nineteenth ward and a Chatham man. The campaign
had developed such bitterness that Whalen
found it necessary to name himself a judge of election
in the fourth precinct of his ward. Many times
during the day blue patrol wagons had rolled into
the precinct.</p>

<p>The polling place of the fourth precinct was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
small barber shop in Fifteenth Street. During the
evening, as the ballots were being counted, it had
become apparent that an altercation was in progress
behind the yellow blinds. It was abruptly terminated
by a shot. The lights in the shop were extinguished
at the same moment. A man burst from the door
and fled. When the police arrived, they found a
dead election judge face downward on the table.
His name had been Brokoski. The bullet had passed
entirely through his body, and reddened with his
blood the ballots that gushed from the overturned
box. The window at his back had been completely
shattered by the ball as it flew out into the alley.
This was a large bullet, a thirty-eight caliber. The
police found a revolver gleaming in the light of the
dark lanterns they flashed down the alley. It was a
thirty-eight caliber with one empty chamber. It was
evident that the murderer had discarded it in his
flight. A lieutenant of police at the Market Place police
station easily identified the gun as one he had
given to Whalen several weeks previously. The
judges and clerks had rushed after Whalen. The
shock, the sudden failure of light, the horror of the
dead man in the dark had jangled their nerves. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
were too excited to give a clear account of the affair.
They knew that Whalen and Brokoski, sitting on
opposite sides of the table, had been quarreling.
They had heard the shot, had been blinded by the
flash, and had seen Whalen bolt. Brokoski had
fallen heavily upon the table, and died with an oath
upon his lips.</p>

<p>Gilman never forgot that wild night. He had
spent it with the governor at the headquarters of the
state central committee. In the dawn, when the east
was yellowing, and sparrows began to scuffle and
splutter on the eaves of the federal building looming
dour just over the way, the news of the murder and
frauds had come to them. The governor&#8217;s face,
white with excitement and fatigue, had suddenly
darkened. Had it been the shadow cast by the
passing of a great ambition?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the close of the long day the woman, beckoned
by Gilman into the governor&#8217;s presence, lingered on
the threshold of the chamber. The room was full
of shadows. The figure of the governor, standing
in the tall window, shut out the waning light, and
was silhouetted, big and black, against the twilight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
sky. He did not hear the woman enter. She coughed
to attract his attention. This did not arouse him
from his reverie, and after a moment&#8217;s timid hesitation,
she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor turned. &#8220;Be seated, madam,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I shall be quite frank with you. I am acquainted
with this case, and do not believe it to be
one justifying executive clemency.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she spoke her voice was tremulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you hear my story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may proceed,&#8221; the governor replied. He
had pushed the papers aside and was drumming
lightly with his long, white fingers on his desk.</p>

<p>The woman nervously pleated her handkerchief,
fearing to begin. &#8220;You must excuse me,&#8221; she said
presently, &#8220;I can not tell my story very well. I do
not come here for mercy or anything like that. It is
only a matter of justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had it not been for the gloom, she might have
seen a smile steal over the face of the dark figure at
the desk. Once plunged into her narrative, her
words flowed rapidly, until&mdash;suddenly she ceased to
speak.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>&#8220;That was five years ago,&#8221; she said, her voice
dropping to a sadly reminiscent whisper. &#8220;We were
to have been married that spring, but&mdash;I would
rather not tell the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman probably felt her cheeks flush with
warmth.</p>

<p>The governor could hear her quick breathing. In
a minute he said kindly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman hesitated an instant, and then fairly
blurted out the rest of her tale. The governor,
through the darkness, saw the woman lean, panting,
toward him. Convulsively she pressed her hands to
her face. She collapsed in tears. When her sobs
became more regular, though still labored, the governor
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;And Whalen&mdash;he knew this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why did he not tell?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman hung her head and said, in a low
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was mistaken, sir. The other woman lied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I see.&#8221; The governor turned and looked out
of the windows. The old-fashioned iron lamps on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
the broad steps that led up to the state house were
blinking in the dark trees, and the arc light swinging
in the street swayed the shadows of their foliage
back and forth on the white walks. A flash of heat
lightning quivered over the purple outlines of the
elms.</p>

<p>The governor sat for a long time in somber silence.
The woman could hear the ticking of his
watch. Presently he drew it from his pocket and
struck a match.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is growing late,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The tale you tell
is a very remarkable tale. My time is so fully occupied
that it will be impossible for me to devote any
thought to it just now. If you will leave your
address with my secretary I shall communicate with
you. Meanwhile&mdash;do not talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the private secretary had conducted the
woman from the room the governor went to his
window. The voices of the June night floated up to
him, but he no longer heard their music. For the
second time, at the name of Whalen, and even in the
darkness, there swept over his face the shadow of
the passing of a great ambition.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>The convention met. The secretary never got
down to <i>S</i> in calling the roll of counties, and the
governor was renominated by acclamation. But
never in all the exciting scenes of those two days, in
the black moment of suspense before the roll-call began,
in the white instant of agony pending the poll
of the Richland County delegation, in the golden
hour of triumph, when he stood pale and bending
before the mad applause rolling up to him in mighty
billows, did he forget the name of Thomas Whalen,
or did the face of that woman pass from him. They
followed him persistently, they glimmered in his
dreams. There was no escape from their pursuit.</p>

<p>After a week in which he found no ease, with
the determination that characterized him when once
aroused, he undertook a judicial investigation of
the case. He obtained a transcript of record, and
read it as carefully as if he had been retained in the
case and sought error upon which to carry it to the
supreme court. In the familiar work he found for
a time relief.</p>

<p>Gilman, meanwhile, had forgotten the incident of
the woman&#8217;s visit. The idea of pardoning Tom
Whalen was too preposterous to merit serious consideration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
But, when the governor told him to go
to the penitentiary and interview Whalen, and then
to the city and the locality of the crime for the purpose
of learning all he could about Brokoski&#8217;s death,
he damned himself for having mentioned the fact of
the woman&#8217;s presence on that crowded, tobacco-clogged,
perspiring morning. And as he left the
capitol he resolved that his visit should be astonishingly
barren of results.</p>

<p>Inside the warden&#8217;s private office at the penitentiary
he saw Whalen. The man had found the convict&#8217;s
friend, consumption, and Gilman hardly knew
him. When the private secretary told him of the
application for his pardon, Whalen only smiled. Gilman
found him strangely reticent, and after an
effort to induce him to talk, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whalen, really now, did you kill Brokoski?&#8221;</p>

<p>The striped convict picked at the cap he held in
his lap. A bitter smile wrinkled his pale, moist face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suspected again, eh?&#8221; he said, without looking
up.</p>

<p>Finally Whalen tired of the examination. He
breathed with difficulty, but that may have been due
to his disease. At last he raised his shaven head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>&#8220;Mr. Gilman,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I see what you&#8217;re getting
at. I have told you I did not commit the crime for
which I am here. For that matter, any of the three
thousand other prisoners within these walls and
wearing these clothes will tell you the same thing. I
don&#8217;t know whether you believe me or not. It
doesn&#8217;t make much difference. It doesn&#8217;t matter
what becomes of me any more. I ain&#8217;t long for this
world. So just let it drop&mdash;what&#8217;s the use of opening
it up again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t answered my question,&#8221; said
Gilman, interested in spite of himself, for a great
fear was growing up within him; &#8220;you have not
told me who did kill Brokoski.&#8221;</p>

<p>The convict lifted his eyelids slowly, and fastened
his vision upon his interlocutor. And then he said
very deliberately and distinctly:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Gilman, and I never will!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gilman left the penitentiary with more than its
gloom upon him. He declined the warden&#8217;s effusive
invitation to stay to dinner. He wanted to get away.
He could not forget the shine in Whalen&#8217;s eyes. And
the fear within possessed him.</p>

<p>When he reached the city, after dining at the chop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
house where his old friends foregathered, he went
out to Fifteenth Street. Costello had sold his barber
shop, and the place had become a saloon. The saloon
was quiet that night. Gilman drank with the bartender,
and, of course, talked about the Brokoski
killing. The bartender had made a study of that
case, and discussed it with the curled lip of the
specialist.</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t do a t&#8217;ing to Tom but t&#8217;row the
hooks into &#8217;im all right, all right. It was a case of
him in the stripes from the start. Say, them lawyer
guys and fly-cops&#8217;d frost you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then carefully locating the actors in the tragedy,
he reproduced it vividly before Gilman&#8217;s eyes.
Brokoski had faced the wall where the hole was.
Whalen&#8217;s back had been to it. Brokoski had sat
with his back to the window. The barkeeper plunged
his red hands into a drawer, rattled a corkscrew, a
knife, a revolver and a jigger, and then drew out
a small piece of lead. It was a thirty-eight caliber
bullet.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the boy that done Brokoski,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get it?&#8221; asked Gilman, with the
mild awe a curio excites in men.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>The bartender pointed to a ragged hole in the
wainscoting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dug it out o&#8217; there with the icepick. I&#8217;m a Sherlock,
see? Sure,&#8221; he sneered, &#8220;it might &#8217;a&#8217; bounced
off the Polock&#8217;s breast.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man wiped his towel over the bar in disgust.</p>

<p>Then seriously:</p>

<p>&#8220;On the dead, Mr. Gilman, if Tom had his rights,
he&#8217;d be sent back to the ward to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gilman was troubled. He returned in the morning
and examined the premises carefully. At two-twenty
that afternoon he was on the Limited, flying
back to the capital.</p>

<p>That evening he was sitting with the governor in
the library of the executive mansion. The windows
were open and the odor of lilacs was borne in from
the summer night. A negro who had served half a
dozen governors, shuffled into the room, bearing a
tray.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s excellent whisky,&#8221; observed the private
secretary.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was excellent whisky, Gilman,&#8221; said the
governor, &#8220;before you were born.&#8221;</p>

<p>The private secretary was rolling a cigarette. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
rolled it with unusual deliberation, licking the rice
paper many times before trusting himself to paste it
down.</p>

<p>The governor bit the end from a black cigar. A
blazing match passed between them.</p>

<p>Then Gilman told of his interview with Whalen.
He did not display much spirit in the telling. When
he had done, he flecked the ash from his cigarette in
a thoughtful way. Resting his forearms on his
knees, he regarded the floor between his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has it ever struck you as peculiar,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that
the bullet was not introduced in evidence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the governor, &#8220;not very.&#8221;</p>

<p>The private secretary paused. When he had done
he laughed. The governor was seriously silent for
many minutes, and then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Leonard, I want you to tell me your theory of
this whole business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gilman sat up. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;had it never
occurred to you that it would have been significant
to determine where that bullet lodged as showing its
direction? It bored a hole clear through Brokoski,
but at which end had it entered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume the medical testimony settled that,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
replied the governor. He seemed to find a species
of relief in this thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Gilman said, &#8220;but the medical testimony
was bad. It consisted of the conclusions of a young
doctor who examined Brokoski&#8217;s body after it had
grown cold. He accepted Whalen&#8217;s guilt as an established
fact. He assumed that the bullet entered
at the breast. There was then nothing to do but to
trace its course through the tissues of the body. If
his views were correct, the ball would have lodged
somewhere behind Brokoski.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it flew out into the alley,&#8221; argued the governor,
&#8220;and shattered the window in doing so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; assented Gilman, &#8220;and yet you assume all
the while that Whalen fired the shot. Of course the
circumstances attending the tragedy, the occasion,
the quarrel, Whalen&#8217;s flight, and the finding of his
gun, lent strong color to that presumption.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the shattered window,&#8221; the governor interpolated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and the shattered window. Now,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;a surgeon, experienced in gunshot wounds,
might have been able to distinguish in such a wound
as Brokoski&#8217;s, the point of the missile&#8217;s entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
from the point of exit. Of course it is not certain.
The youth the police called did not think such an inquiry
important, whereas it was vital. A pistol fired
point-blank at a man would blacken his breast with
powder. The velocity of the ball, fired at such range
might have been sufficient to knock the man over
backward, instead of allowing him to fall upon his
face as he did. Then, there&#8217;s the window. It was
shattered, the police said, by the ball. Even the glass
in the upper sash was broken. The frame on the
outside was blackened by powder, the stains even
now being visible. Now, a bullet flying the distance
it must have traversed between Whalen&#8217;s hand and
the window, would, in all probability, simply have
perforated the glass with a round, clean hole. But
the weapon having been fired in close proximity, the
concussion shattered the whole window.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a silence Gilman resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then, assume that the bullet entered Brokoski&#8217;s
back and emerged from his breast. The conclusion
deduced from the circumstances I have suggested,
is impregnable when that bullet is located in
a position in front of Brokoski.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the recital the governor lay in his deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
chair, his arms across his breast, his finger-tips
together. He regarded Gilman through half-closed
eyes. A thoughtful observer would have said that
he had heard the essential elements of the tale before.
When he spoke, after a silence which had
begun to annoy the private secretary, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, your hypothesis is tenable. In fact, it is
one of the prettiest cases I ever saw put together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gilman stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;But did you learn anything as to the identity of
the person, who, if your suppositions are correct,
killed Brokoski?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the weak point,&#8221; Gilman promptly admitted.
&#8220;A sufficient motive is utterly lacking, if
we eliminate partisan hatred. It was shown that
Whalen killed him in an impulse of passion, and that
alone saved him from the death penalty. But I feel
that my reasoning is valid. The conviction was
strengthened by Whalen&#8217;s manner and expression
the other day. He never killed Brokoski, I tell you.&#8221;
Gilman smote his thigh for emphasis. &#8220;Why he
chooses to die in prison a silent martyr I don&#8217;t know&mdash;but
the woman does.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor assumed a sitting posture.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>&#8220;Damn it!&#8221; exclaimed Gilman, after a momentary
silence, &#8220;if those stupid police had examined the mud
in the alley beneath the window that night, they
would have found tracks that would have changed
the course of this whole business.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor bent farther forward, burying himself
in an intense concentration of mind. For a
time interminable to Gilman, he sat thus. His cigar
went out. The ice in his glass melted, spun on the
crystal brim, and sank with a tiny splash and tinkle.
The little pile of burned cigarettes, the black ends of
consumed cigars, the mass of tobacco ash deposited
in a whisky glass, absorbed its tepid liquid, and
stunk. The room grew chill, and the mists of the
fountain which played in mournful solitude beneath
the rocking elms in the grounds, permeated the atmosphere.
The brooding night added her terrors
and her cares.</p>

<p>Gilman took a sip of liquor, lighted a fresh cigarette,
rose, and walked up and down the room. He
thought of the election, so near at hand. He looked
at the governor bowed there before him. What was
Whalen, or the woman, or anybody to him? Let the
prisoner die! What was he to the governor? John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
Chatham&#8217;s party needed him, his country needed
him, his time needed him, mankind and human progress
needed him. If he pardoned Whalen, what
was to become of him? The conviction of Brokoski&#8217;s
murderer alone could save him from such apparent
stultification, here on the eve of an election at which,
in the foolish phrase of modern politics, he sought
vindication. Was this conviction possible? The
bare thought halted Gilman beside the governor. He
laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;These abstruse propositions wouldn&#8217;t stand before
a jury in a criminal court,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let
Whalen stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor lifted his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you just now said that he was not Brokoski&#8217;s
murderer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gilman hesitated. When he spoke, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;A jury of twelve sworn men has said that he is.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two days after the private secretary&#8217;s return, the
newspapers were full of stories concerning his movements.
Whalen&#8217;s picture was exploited, correspondents
sought the governor for interviews, and
the <i>Courier</i> charged that, in his desperation, he intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
to pardon Whalen, that he might have, in his
campaign, the assistance of that skilled and unscrupulous
manipulator. The pack of country newspapers
took up the <i>Courier&#8217;s</i> cry. Whalen&#8217;s illness
was either ignored, or referred to as feigned, at the
direction of prison authorities and the governor.
And yet a certificate pigeonholed in Gilman&#8217;s desk,
signed by the prison physician, stated that Thomas
Whalen had pulmonary tuberculosis and was in a
moribund condition.</p>

<p>In his office in the city William Handy, the chairman
of the state central committee, read these newspaper
stories, and swore as he did so. That night
the shrewdest and maddest politician in the state
stole out of town. The next morning Gilman was
surprised when the big man burst through the door
marked &#8220;private,&#8221; brushed by him and entered, unannounced,
the governor&#8217;s chambers. Before the
stately door swung to behind him, Gilman heard
him demand:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this I hear about your pardoning
Tom Whalen?&#8221;</p>

<p>The private secretary did not hear the governor&#8217;s
reply, for with deliberate step he had crossed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
room and closed the door. He heard nothing clearly,
for Handy&#8217;s voice came to him smothered, and the
governor&#8217;s not at all. Once he thought he heard
&#8220;mawkish sentiment,&#8221; and &#8220;the action of a political
imbecile,&#8221; but what he mostly distinguished was
muffled profanity. The young man for the first time
in his experience was delighted when his bell buzzed
just then. When he entered upon the scene, the
governor, rocking complacently in his high-backed
chair, was saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;But what if it&#8217;s my duty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Duty be damned!&#8221; shouted Handy, rising to his
feet, and smiting the desk with a heavy fist he had
had folded during the conversation. The wrath
which the politician had kept bottled up overnight
had burst out at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am running this campaign,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and as
long as I do run it, I do not propose to tolerate such
incredible folly as pardoning Tom Whalen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gilman, wide-eyed, gazed in amaze at the two
men. Handy stood glaring at the governor, his
fist fastened where it had fallen. The governor&#8217;s
lips were tightly compressed. A sheet of scarlet
swept over his dark face. Both men were strong-willed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
The tensity of such a moment could not
long endure. Its contagion spread to Gilman&#8217;s
nerves. The governor&#8217;s splendid frame seemed to
dilate, and Gilman suddenly became conscious that
the admiration he had always given the man had
never before measured up to the fullness of John
Chatham&#8217;s deserts. It was with relief that he saw
the governor&#8217;s glance turn from Handy to bend on
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gilman,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have a pardon made out for
Thomas Whalen.&#8221;</p>

<p>This answer to Handy&#8217;s threats was punctuated
by a flash from the governor&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Gilman&mdash;&#8221; the governor continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wire that woman&mdash;what&#8217;s her name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;Barry&mdash;wire her to come. I think I shall
prefer to tell her myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Handy dropped, heavy with exhaustion, into his
chair. He tried to speak, but had trouble with his
articulation. When he mastered his tongue, he
could only blurt:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you have done it, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the governor in gentle assent, &#8220;I have
done it.&#8221; The sigh that ended this remark was one
in which a heart-burdening care was dissipated. It
was a sigh that resolved a vast difficulty.</p>

<p>When the woman came the next morning, Gilman
led her at once into the governor&#8217;s presence.
Before him lay a large document, lettered in preposterous
script, lined in red ink. The woman knew
this imitation parchment to be the pardon of
Thomas Whalen. The governor rose and stood
until she had seated herself, and then said, drawing
the pardon on the desk to him, &#8220;I have decided to
grant the application for Whalen&#8217;s pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman&#8217;s fingers clawed the carved arms of
the chair. Gilman stared with parted lips. The
governor continued as he hastily scanned the pardon:</p>

<p>&#8220;I take this action because circumstances recently
revealed lead me to believe that Whalen is innocent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor dipped his pen in the ink.</p>

<p>&#8220;They form a very abstruse proposition,&#8221; he said,
poising his pen nicely in his fingers, &#8220;and I am not
sure that every one can grasp it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>The governor spoke meditatively. The two persons
in the room silently regarded him. Something
in the man, in the moment, impelled awe. He set
his hand to the paper to write, but paused an instant
longer. His eyes wandered from the document. As
he raised them over her, the woman bowed her head.
Out through the open window, out through the summer
morning, over the wimpling foliage of the trees,
far, far away they gazed. And then he sighed, as a
woman sighs, and turning, signed the pardon of
Thomas Whalen. A moment he sat still as an
ancient statue, and then dropping the pen on the
desk, he turned toward Gilman with a smile. The
action relieved the young man from the spell which
bound him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going before the people with that story
I worked up?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Fiercely, without awaiting a reply to a question
already answered, he wheeled on the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see what he has done? He has given up
all&mdash;he has killed himself! He says Whalen is innocent&mdash;and
doesn&#8217;t even know upon whom to fasten
suspicion! Don&#8217;t you&mdash;my God, woman&mdash;can&#8217;t you
see?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>Slowly the situation was borne in upon her understanding.
Her mouth opened with a gasp, her eyes
widened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; she said, jerking her words from a choking
throat. &#8220;He knows who did it. I told him. It
was&mdash;me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door latch clicked behind her. She turned
in the direction whence came the sound, and repeated,
as if the interrupter contradicted her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did it. I killed Brokoski.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her strength failed her. She sobbed convulsively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I&mdash;did&mdash;it,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;I&mdash;did&mdash;it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gilman stared in wonder. Here, then, was the
person who had stood in the alley beneath the window
that night, whose footprints would have led
him to the solution of his mystery, to the end of his
clever chain. The problem of her motive for slaying
Brokoski alone remained. He longed to ask her,
but she had collapsed unconscious in her chair.
Turning to the governor he implored light. A word
informed him of the accidental killing of Brokoski
by a jealous woman who was trying to shoot his vis-&agrave;-vis.
Then he demanded in tones reproachful:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>&#8220;Why did you not tell me this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; the man quietly responded, &#8220;I do not
war on women.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door whose latch had clicked had opened
wide, and William Handy entered, smiling.</p>

<p>Governor Chatham was assorting papers on his
desk, as a man would whose routine work had received
a trifling interruption. Handy remained on
his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; he said, &#8220;John, I take off my hat to you.
I admire your nerve. I recognized it years ago,
that day you presided over our convention in the old
seventh district&mdash;remember?&mdash;the day you turned
me down so hard. Remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;This ain&#8217;t flattery,&#8221; said Handy, seating himself
in a leather chair. &#8220;You&#8217;re not only all I&#8217;ve said,
you&#8217;re a devil of a good fellow to boot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Handy spoke seldom. He never wrote letters, but
sent word, according to an ancient maxim uttered
by one of the political fathers. But when he did
speak, he spoke bluntly, in the same tone in which
he would have called a man a liar. The governor
raised his hand to stay Handy&#8217;s compliments.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>&#8220;Yes, John,&#8221; he persisted. &#8220;You&#8217;re a hell of a
good fellow, but,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you&#8217;re a damn poor
politician.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was the faintest shadow of a smile on the
governor&#8217;s face. Handy closed his eyes until they
were the merest slits. He puffed his cigar back to
life.</p>

<p>His head was wrapped in scarfs of smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;When does the grand jury sit?&#8221; he inquired,
after a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not till the December term.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can have a special one impaneled. I&#8217;ll have
Donnelly call it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Donnelly was a judge of dignity and erudition,
and Handy spoke of him as if he were his hired man,
which he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boys&#8217;ll be glad to get Tom back in the nineteenth.
O&#8217;Rourke says&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Handy,&#8221; said the governor, whirling
about in his chair, and speaking as sharply as a precinct
captain at a primary. &#8220;I want none of Tom
Whalen&#8217;s work in the nineteenth&mdash;not while I&#8217;m
running for governor. But then,&#8221; he added gravely,
&#8220;he&#8217;s only going back to the nineteenth to die.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>Handy grunted. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll have Fitzgerald
pinch the girl anyway, and keep her in the Division
Street station till after election.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor looked at Handy. &#8220;William,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;you might as well understand now, that that
would be wholly useless. I am convinced of Whalen&#8217;s
innocence absolutely, beyond all doubt, but
it will be impossible to get a jury to convict the one
who did kill Brokoski on such evidence as convinced
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she confesses,&#8221; urged Handy.</p>

<p>&#8220;To whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. But what if that confession be a privileged
communication?&#8221;</p>

<p>Handy looked up in amazement. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
mean you wouldn&#8217;t testify?&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor&#8217;s countenance lost its legal expression,
and became suddenly human. If Handy had
been a thinner man he would have jumped when the
governor said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I would send a woman to the penitentiary
to elect myself governor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure confessions to a governor are privileges?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
inquired Handy, who was adhering to practical
things.</p>

<p>The governor&#8217;s face put on its legal mask again,
and he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the question is unsettled&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who presides in the criminal court this winter?&#8221;
inquired Handy, &#8220;any of our fellows?&#8221; Handy&#8217;s
whole philosophy of life was pull. The governor
resumed, without answering:</p>

<p>&#8220;The question has never been decided. Mr. Chief
Justice Marshall, upon the trial of Aaron Burr,
ruled, if I remember, that a <i>subp&#339;na duces tecum</i>
might be issued to the president for a letter addressed
to him, leaving the question of the production
of the letter&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, say, John,&#8221; broke in Handy, &#8220;Burr&#8217;s dead,
isn&#8217;t he? And he wasn&#8217;t a good fellow, anyway, or
he&#8217;d never got in that far. Go on with your legalities&mdash;I
myself do not propose to go to jail for contempt
for refusing to testify.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you to do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing much,&#8221; said Handy, &#8220;only I happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
to be inside that door just now when she confessed&mdash;and
there&#8217;s Gilman besides.&#8221; Handy, his
cigar tilted upward, smoked on voluminously and
smiled through the smoke with deep satisfaction.
The governor averted his face. Lines of trouble
drew themselves across his brow. Presently he
turned to the chairman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Handy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I may be re&euml;lected and I may
not&mdash;probably not. However that may be, I insist
upon this: I want that woman, for the present, let
alone. I have faith in the people. I am willing to
go to them on my record. They may or may not
re&euml;lect me. I shall not, at any rate, have my motives
impugned. I only want, when the turmoil has subsided,
when the subject can be viewed with clear
eyes and investigated by clear heads and clean
hands, to see justice done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Handy, &#8220;to hell with justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; asked the governor, &#8220;what do you
say to a little mercy now and then?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THAT BOY</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT must have been sometime in the winter or
spring of 1891 that I first saw him. I had just
been elected to the legislature. It was the famous
Reform Session, you will remember, that proved to
be of such benefit to stenographers and space writers.
During the six months that general assembly lasted
I lived at the St. James hotel. It is probable that I
first saw the boy behind the counter of the cigar
stand in the lobby of the hotel. It is probable that I
had seen and spoken to him many times before I
gave him any especial notice. What first arrested
my attention was a law book. I had stopped at the
cigar stand one evening after dinner to get some
cigars, and as he rose to attend upon my wants,
he took the book from his lap and laid it down upon
the counter. While he was under the counter getting
out a box of the brand I wished&mdash;for I never relish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
somehow, cigars taken from a show case&mdash;I turned
the book over and idly looked at its title. I remember
very well that it was Reeves&#8217; <i>History of the English
Law</i>. It struck me as rather odd that a boy behind
a cigar stand should be reading such a book. It was
not a book that law students, in my state, at any
rate, generally read. I know that I never read it
(through) and probably never shall read it, although
it is, of course, a wise and ancient book. I asked
him why he read it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m studying law!&#8221;</p>

<p>As I lighted a cigar, I looked at the boy. He was
tall and overgrown, and thin with his overgrowth,
with spare wrists that thrust themselves out of
frayed cuffs. His face was sallow, and he was not
good to look upon. His clothes were worn bare to
the threads. He had every appearance of being
poor, almost hungry. I fancy I disliked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you expect to be admitted?&#8221; I asked
casually.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he replied, blithely enough, &#8220;in two or three
years. Then I go into politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>This, I have said, was in 1891. If anything impressed
me, it was the hopelessness of it all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>In 1893, early in the summer, I went down to the
capital to argue a case at the June term of the supreme
court. In the evening, after a hard day in
court, I strolled out Lafayette Street to mollify my
nerves. Toward the edge of the town I saw a thin
youth walking with a girl. The girl wore a white
dress. The evening was balmy. The moon was shining.
The lilacs were in bloom, and their odor was on
the air. As we passed each other, the youth&#8217;s appearance
struck me as familiar. At the time I
thought that he was the boy who used to tend the
cigar stand in the St. James, and read Reeves&#8217; <i>History
of the English Law</i>, whom I had naturally forgotten.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1898&mdash;I remember the time, not,
of course, because it has anything to do with the boy
but because we were then engaged in the track elevation
cases&mdash;I went over to the Gregory Building one
morning to see Judge Goodman, in order to get him
to consent to the Updegraff case going over the
term. That was a case which involved the doctrine
of merger, and I needed some additional time for
preparation.</p>

<p>As I entered the offices of Goodman, Peck, Gilmore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
and Eckhart, I turned to the office boy, who
was sitting near the door at the futile little desk all
office boys occupy, and on which they scribble mysterious
things, to ask whether the judge was in.
When I spoke to the boy he looked up and smiled
and called me by name. He seemed to be, for some
reason, glad to see me, as if I had been some one
from home. In fact, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been down lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>I examined him quite attentively for an instant.
He had half risen from his chair, and stood, or hung,
in an awkward attitude over his desk. Presently I
recognized him as the boy who used to tend the cigar
stand in the hotel at the state capital, and read
Reeves&#8217; <i>History of the English Law</i>. I asked him
what he was doing in the city.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, in apparent surprise at my question,
&#8220;I&#8217;m practising law!&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes, in his pale face, dilated with a childish
pride, until they were large and round and brilliant.
He had drawn himself quite erect, and now he
waved his hand toward the wall, and there I saw, in
a new oak frame, the old familiar law license the
supreme court issues to poor devils with illusions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
There it was, bearing the seal of the court and the
signatures of the seven justices. I read the boy&#8217;s
name, written on the imitation parchment. It was
the first time I had ever known what he called himself.
I was amused by his having had his license
framed.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are in Judge Goodman&#8217;s office, are you?&#8221;
I said, rather ineptly, to be sure, but merely to have
something to say.</p>

<p>He made the obvious reply, and spoke of Judge
Goodman&#8217;s kindness to him. I asked him how he
was getting along.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;rather slowly, of course&mdash;just
at first, you know. But then I think if I can
stick it out a while&mdash;say five or six years&mdash;I&#8217;ll be
all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>I kept on looking at the old familiar law license,
and thinking of my own. I have not seen it for
years. I think my wife has it somewhere, in a tin
tube with the diplomas and our marriage certificate
and her father&#8217;s discharge from the army and other
family charters, if it is not lost.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;for I felt that I should say something&mdash;I
asked him how everybody was in the capital.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get down any more,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it costs,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he was silent, and I did not care to
look in his eyes. I noticed that the black cravat he
had on was very old, and worn through in places.
Also that he was actually out at the elbows, as to
the right arm at least, for there, in the sleeve, was
a ragged hole that showed the soiled lining of his
coat. Presently the boy said:</p>

<p>&#8220;When you go down, tell them you saw me, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course it was presumptuous in him, but I
thought of those five or six years. In that time he
would learn&mdash;that and other things. Just then Judge
Goodman stuck his head out of his private room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I happened to go to the capital in May of that
year. We were then at war, you will remember. I
told the man who kept the cigar stand in the lobby
of the St. James that I had seen the boy in the city,
that he was practising law there, and wished to be
remembered to his friends. I think I told him, also,
that the boy was doing well, and already making a
favorable impression upon many of the older and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
more prominent members of the bar. But the man
shook his head and responded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, haven&#8217;t you heard? He&#8217;s gone to war&mdash;enlisted
in the First Infantry!&#8221;</p>

<p>I hid my surprise from the man, and told him I
had heard that, of course, but that the bar regarded
his absence as merely temporary.</p>

<p>That summer I got into the habit of scanning the
lists of sick and disabled soldiers who were at Chickamauga
and the other fever camps, or in Cuba. I was
especially likely to do this where the First Regiment
was concerned. It was a practice foolish in a way,
because it took up time in the morning, and was only
a meaningless list of names, anyway. But then, we
were rather proud of the First in the city that summer,
for it was our crack regiment, you know, and
my wife had one or two acquaintances among the
young officers, who reflected a certain glory upon
her, and gave a color to her conversation.</p>

<p>A friend of mine at the capital, a lawyer, often
sent me, two or three times a week, perhaps, copies
of the local papers, and these frequently published
little bits of personal gossip about boys from that
town who had gone to &#8220;the front,&#8221; as they put it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
The country papers gave a more personal tone to
their war articles than did the city papers. These
latter seemed to think that a war is got up especially
for the officers. Doubtless they were about
right.</p>

<p>After a while, the First went to Cuba. The regiment
got there too late for active fighting in the operations
about Santiago, but not too late for duty in
the trenches, with their freshly upturned earth, damp
and saturated with malaria. Nor did they get there
too late for the fever. Many of them contracted it,
and some died of it. I used to read the lists of the
sick and dead, to see if the names of any of my
wife&#8217;s acquaintances in the field, line or staff, were
among them.</p>

<p>Once in a while I would observe that some young
soldier had died of something or other and homesickness.
One morning I happened upon a name that impressed
me as being familiar. After studying it a
while, I finally recognized it as the same name that
had been upon the law license that was framed in
oak and hanging above the desk of the office boy.
There was printed after the name:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pernicious malaria and nostalgia.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>In the spring of the following year (1899) the
bodies of several hundred soldiers who had died in
Cuba were brought home for final interment. I happened
to be in the capital again and heard that there
was to be a military funeral that afternoon. I had
some curiosity to see a military funeral, and so, having
nothing else to do, went to the church where it
was to be held. You can imagine my surprise when
I was told that it was the funeral of the boy who had
once tended the cigar stand in the lobby of the St.
James and read Reeves&#8217; <i>History of the English Law</i>,
the boy who had afterward gone to the city to practise
law, and, later, enlisted in the First Infantry to
die in Cuba. There were not many at the funeral,
for, of course, he was only a private. There was a
woman there in black, probably his aunt, or mother,
for she appeared to weep, and some girl. Out at the
cemetery&mdash;Oak Wood, where a general is buried&mdash;there
were few persons besides the clergyman, and
the woman and the girl. A local militia company
had sent a firing squad, and it fired the salute prescribed
for a private over the grave, and a bugler
stood at the head and blew taps, the soldier&#8217;s good
night. Happening to have a rose or two with me, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
threw them into the grave. The coffin, of course,
had a flag over it, but that was about all there was of
the military funeral&mdash;hardly enough, indeed, to reward
one&#8217;s curiosity.</p>

<p>This, I believe, is all. The story hardly seems
worth the telling, now that it is written, but I fancied
that I detected one or two coincidences in my haphazard
relations with the boy, like my reading of
his death in the paper, and my happening to be in
the capital on the day of his funeral, and so I set
them down.</p>

<p>I forgot to say that I happened to have his law
license with me that day at the funeral. After he
had enlisted in the First, perhaps I should explain, I
noticed it one day in the offices of Goodman, Peck,
Gilmore and Eckhart, where it was evidently in the
way. So I let it hang in my office all that summer
and all the next winter, but in the spring we needed
the wall space for some new bookcases, and I took
it down. I think the girl who was at the funeral
that day, whoever she is, has it now.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
